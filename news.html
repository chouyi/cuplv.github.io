                        	</em></h4>
                  <div>
                     <h4>Abstract</h4>
                     	  
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Twitter is one of the most heavily trafficked sites on
                        	  the internet, with over 140 million active users and serving
                        	  over 400 million Tweets per day. Historically, nearly all of
                        	  Twitter's traffic has been served by a monolithic
                        	  application written in Ruby on Rails, referred to internally
                        	  as "the monorail." Although Twitter has seen remarkable
                        	  growth in its six years of existence, scaling this
                        	  monolithic architecture has proved to be both error-prone
                        	  and expensive, not only in terms of computational
                        	  efficiency, but in terms of developer efficiency as well.
                     </p>
                     	  
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">More recently, Twitter has begun the process of replacing
                        	  the monorail with a Services Oriented Architecture (SOA),
                        	  where the services are JVM processes--mostly written in
                        	  Scala--that communicate with one-another asynchronously over
                        	  a network connection. Naively written, asynchronous code is
                        	  often both tedious to write and difficult to reason about;
                        	  at Twitter, the asynchronous code implementing Scala
                        	  services is both simple and beautiful, thanks in large part
                        	  to an internally-developed, open-source library called
                        	  Finagle.
                     </p>
                     	  
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">In this talk, I will attempt to explain how Finagle's
                        	  strong grounding in programming language theory has
                        	  facilitated this transition to an SOA, and how Scala's
                        	  advanced features allow for a library as expressive as
                        	  Finagle to have been written in the first place.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">In this talk, I present a simple yet
                        	  effective approach to automatically searching for property
                        	  violations in non-linear systems.  Our approach defines the
                        	  notion of robustness metrics over traces that can be used to
                        	  measure distances between simulation traces and properties
                        	  expressed in temporal logics.  As a result, robustness
                        	  metrics can naturally quantify how "close" a particular
                        	  simulation of the system is to violating a property of
                        	  interest.  By treating robustness metrics as an objective
                        	  function to minimize over the simulation traces of the
                        	  system, we can use many off-the-shelf global optimization
                        	  techniques to effectively steer the simulations towards a
                        	  falsification of the property being considered.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Despite the lack of strong formal guarantees, we find
                        	  that robustness-guided falsification is a promising approach
                        	  to searching for property violations in complex systems.  We
                        	  present the S-Taliro tool, an implementation of our approach
                        	  to reason about properties of non-linear systems modeled as
                        	  Simulink/Stateflow diagrams.  We present two interesting
                        	  case studies using S-Taliro, including a risk analysis of
                        	  insulin infusion pump usage by diabetic patients that models
                        	  the software in the pump in conjunction with the dynamics of

                        	  Towards the Verification of Hybrid Data-Flow Languages
                        	</em></h4>

                     <h4>Abstract</h4>
                     	  
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Hybrid systems are used to model embedded computing
                        	  systems interacting with their physical environment. There
                        	  is a conceptual mismatch between high-level hybrid system
                        	  languages, like Simulink, which are used for simulation, and
                        	  hybrid automata, the most suitable representation for safety
                        	  verification. Indeed, in simulation languages the
                        	  interaction between discrete and continuous execution steps
                        	  is specified using the concept of zero-crossings, whereas
                        	  hybrid automata exploit the notion of staying conditions.
                        	  In this talk we first briefly present Zelus, a synchronous
                        	  data-flow language extended with ordinary differential
                        	  equations.  Then we propose a sound translation from a
                        	  Zelus-like hybrid data-flow formalism to logico-numerical
                        	  hybrid automata discussing various zero-crossing semantics
                        	  and the extent to which the original semantics is preserved.
                        	  At last we sketch how existing continuous reachability
                        	  analysis methods can be applied to logico-numerical hybrid
                        	  automata.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Finding bugs is among the most challenging tasks in
                        	  software development.  For this reason, modern software
                        	  development methodologies encourage programmers to use
                        	  assertions throughout their code to express the assumptions
                        	  they are making.  At runtime, these assertions then detect
                        	  whenever the assumptions do not match the program; in other
                        	  words, they detect bugs early.  However, traditional
                        	  assertion mechanisms in mainstream languages such as C or
                        	  Java are limited in their expressivity.
                     </p>
                     	  
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">This talk presents DeAL, a rich heap assertion language
                        	  for Java that extends over the expressive power of
                        	  traditional assertions.  DeAL introduces additional
                        	  primitives to reason over heap layout, allowing programmers
                        	  to assert global invariants, ownership, and other properties
                        	  that would be impossible to express in traditional
                        	  assertions.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">By design, all DeAL assertions require only a single heap
                        	  traversal and can execute as part of garbage collection.
                        	  Consequently, DeAL is not only expressive, but also ensures
                        	  a very low execution overhead.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Recent years have seen intensive interest among
                        	  Programming Language (PL) researchers in connecting PL and
                        	  Verification.  Static analyses which once were primarily
                        	  intended for enabling optimizations in compilers are now
                        	  used also for program verification and bug finding.  Type
                        	  systems, which had been used to detect (either statically or
                        	  dynamically) low-level bugs, are now pushed to express
                        	  stronger and stronger semantic properties of code.  Arguably
                        	  the most powerful such systems known are so-called dependent
                        	  type systems, which combine programming and theorem proving,
                        	  and use rich types to express general logical specifications
                        	  of programs.

                        	  design, prove, and implement dependently typed programming
                        	  languages, and apply them for challenging case studies.  I
                        	  will summarize the design of the Guru dependently typed
                        	  programming language, and explain how it overcomes some

                        	  concerning general recursion and also the treatment of
                        	  equality.  For a case study, I will describe recent work of
                        	  my doctoral student Duckki Oe to implement a statically
                        	  verified modern SAT solver called versat in Guru. Versat

                        	  of modern solvers like Minisat, but has been statically
                        	  verified to be sound: if versat reports "unsat", then the
                        	  input formula is truly contradictory.  Versat can solve
                        	  benchmarks on the modern scale, including some from the SAT

                  <div>
                     <h4>Abstract</h4>
                     	  I will describe an efficient procedure for proving
                     	  stabilisation of biological systems when modeled as
                     	  qualitative networks or genetic regulatory networks. For
                     	  scalability, we use modular proof techniques, where
                     	  state-space exploration is applied only locally to small
                     	  pieces of the system rather than the entire system as a
                     	  whole. Our procedure exploits the observation that, in
                     	  practice, the form of modular proofs can be restricted to a
                     	  very limited set.  Using our new procedure, we have solved a
                     	  number of challenging published examples, including: a 3-D
                     	  model of the mammalian epidermis; a model of metabolic
                     	  networks operating in type-2 diabetes; a model of fate
                     	  determination of vulval precursor cells in the C. elegans
                     	  worm; and a model of pair-rule regulation during
                     	  segmentation in the Drosophila embryo. Our results show many
                     	  orders of magnitude speedup in cases where previous
                     	  stabilization proving techniques were known to succeed, and
                     	  new results in cases where tools had previously failed.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Multi-core and multi-processor systems are becoming
                        	  increasingly popular. However, our ability to effectively
                        	  harness the power of parallelism is predicated upon advances
                        	  in tools and algorithms for verifying concurrent
                        	  programs. Concurrent programs are notoriously difficult to
                        	  verify, and a key reason for this is the behavioral
                        	  complexity resulting from the large number of interleavings
                        	  of concurrent threads.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">In this talk, I will introduce a symbolic predictive
                        	  analysis for runtime detection of concurrency errors, by
                        	  monitoring and subsequently analyzing the execution traces
                        	  of a program. In this analysis, we first derive a symbolic
                        	  predictive model using the trace information collected at
                        	  run time as well as the program source code. What this model
                        	  captures are not just the given traces, but all possible
                        	  interleavings of events of these traces. Then we use
                        	  symbolic reasoning to check whether there are concurrency
                        	  errors in any of these interleavings. This is done by

                  <div>
                     <h4>Abstract</h4>
                     	  I will describe some new methods of proving temporal
                     	  properties of infinite-state programs.  Our approach takes
                     	  advantage of the fact that linear-temporal properties can
                     	  often be proved more efficiently using proof techniques
                     	  usually associated with the branching-time logic CTL.  The
                     	  caveat is that, in certain instances, nondeterminism in the
                     	  system's transition relation can cause CTL methods to report
                     	  counterexamples that are spurious in LTL. To address this
                     	  problem we describe an algorithm that, as it attempts to
                     	  apply CTL proof methods, finds and then removes problematic
                     	  nondeterminism via an analysis on the spurious
                     	  counterexamples. We must also develop CTL symbolic model
                     	  checking tools for infinite-state systems.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Most programs get used in just one direction, from input
                        	  to output. But sometimes, having computed an output, we need
                        	  to be able to update this output and then "calculate
                        	  backwards" to find a correspondingly updated input. The
                        	  problem of writing such bidirectional transformations --
                        	  often called lenses -- arises in applications across a

                        	  perspectives. Potential applications include synchronization
                        	  of replicated data, system configuration management tools
                        	  (such as RedHat's Augeas system), bidirectional
                        	  transformations between software models, and updatable

                        	  exploring a linguistic approach to bidirectional
                        	  programming, designing domain-specific languages in which
                        	  every expression simultaneously describes both parts of a
                        	  lens. When read from left to right, an expression denotes an
                        	  ordinary function that maps inputs to outputs. When read
                        	  from right to left, it denotes an "update translator" that
                        	  takes an input together with an updated output and produces
                        	  a new input that reflects the update. These languages share

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">We have designed, implemented, and applied bi-directional
                        	  languages in three quite different domains: a language for
                        	  bidirectional transformations on trees (such as XML
                        	  documents), based on a collection of primitive bidirectional
                        	  tree transformation operations and
                        	  "bidirectionality-preserving" combining forms; a language
                        	  for bidirectional views of relational data, using
                        	  bidirectionalized versions of the operators of relational
                        	  algebra as primitives; and, most recently, a language for
                        	  bidirectional string transformations, with primitives based
                        	  on standard notations for finite-state transduction and a
                        	  type system based on regular expressions. The string case is
                        	  especially interesting, both in its own right and because it
                        	  exposes a number of foundational issues common to all
                        	  bidirectional programming languages in a simple and familiar

                     <h4>Abstract</h4>
                     	  
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">When parallel programming started in the 70s and 80s, it
                        	  was mostly art: languages such as functional and logic
                        	  programming languages were designed and appreciated mainly
                        	  for their elegance and beauty. More recently, parallel
                        	  programming has become engineering: conventional languages
                        	  like FORTRAN and C++ have been extended with constructs such
                        	  as OpenMP, and we now spend our time benchmarking and
                        	  tweaking large programs nobody understands to obtain
                        	  performance improvements of 5-10%. In spite of all this
                        	  activity, we have few insights into how to write parallel
                        	  programs to exploit the performance potential of multicore
                        	  processors.
                     </p>
                     	  
                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">To break this impasse, we need a science of parallel
                        	  programming. In this talk, I will introduce a concept called
                        	  "amorphous data-parallelism" that provides a simple, unified
                        	  picture of parallelism in a host of diverse applications
                        	  ranging from mesh generation/refinement/partitioning to SAT
                        	  solvers, maxflow algorithms, stencil computations, and
                        	  event-driven simulation. Then I will present a natural
                        	  classification that provides insight into the structure of
                        	  parallelism and locality in these algorithms and into
                        	  appropriate language and systems support for exploiting this
                        	  parallelism.

                  <div>
                     <h4>Abstract</h4>
                     	  Desktop software, in the form of web browsers, browser
                     	  features, and OS distributions, are a growing area of
                     	  engineering activity at Google. This talk will give an
                     	  overview of this work, looking in detail at Native Client as
                     	  an example project in the space. Native Client is an
                     	  open-source research technology for running x86 native code
                     	  in web applications, with the goal of maintaining the
                     	  browser neutrality, OS portability, and safety that people
                     	  expect from web apps. It supports performance-oriented
                     	  features generally absent from web application programming
                     	  environments, such as thread support, instruction set
                     	  extensions such as SSE, and use of compiler intrinsics and
                     	  hand-coded assembler. We combine these properties in an open
                     	  architecture designed to leverage existing web standards,
                     	  and to encourage community review and third-party
                     	  tools. Overall, Google's desktop efforts seek to enable new
                     	  Web applications, improve end-user experience, and enable a
                     	  more flexible balance between client and server
                     	  computing. Google has open sourced many of our desktop
                     	  efforts, in part to encourage collaboration and independent
                     	  innovation.

                        	  transformation of loops. Many of the existing models fit
                        	  within the polyhedral framework and although they are quite
                        	  powerful, they are restricted to compile-time

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">This talk will describe a growing
                        	  family of synthesizers based on partial programs.  Their
                        	  premise is that programs can be decomposed into insight and
                        	  mechanics: if the programmer encodes her insight as a
                        	  partial program, the mechanics can then be synthesized given
                        	  a specification.  Partial programs lend themselves to
                        	  algorithmic synthesis: rather than deducing a program with a
                        	  theorem prover, algorithmic synthesis finds the program in a
                        	  space of candidate implementations described by the partial
                        	  program.

                     <p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Among five synthesizers, I will describe an algorithm for
                        	  finding a candidate by constraint solving, rather than via
                        	  generate-and-test, and a system for programming with angelic
                        	  non-determinism which computes the insight into a
                        	  programming problem.

                     	  Ras Bodik is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at
                     	  UC Berkeley.  He is interested in programming systems, from
                     	  static and dynamic analysis to programmer tools.  He leads a
                     	  project of program synthesis for high-performance programs
                     	  based on the idea of program sketches.  He also leads a
                     	  project on parallel web browsers for mobile devices, which
                     	  develops parallel parsing and page layout algorithms, as
                     	  well as a constraints-based scripting language.
