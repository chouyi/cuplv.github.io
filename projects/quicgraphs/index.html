      <p>
        QUIC Graphs offer an efficient means for generating abstract
        domains representing sets and set properties of containers.
        To demonstrate the analyzer, we present two demo programs
        using two different underlying scalar domains.  These will
        demonstrate the results of the analysis and the flexibility of
        the analysis.
      </p>

      <h3>Preparing to Run Demos</h3>

      <p>
        The analyzer is provided as a VirtualBox virtual machine.
      Install the virtual machine and run it.  It will boot to a Linux
      desktop.  Start the terminal and enter the following
      commands:
      </p>

      <code>$ cd set_analysis/demo</code>

      <h3>Selecting Scalar Domains</h3>
      <p>
        Because QUIC graphs build abstract domains from scalar
      abstract domains we can select from two different abstract
      domains.  The default scalar abstract domain is the APRON
      polyhedron-based domain, but there are a variety of domains from
      which to choose:
      </p>

      <table border>
        <tr><th>Flag</th><th>Domain</th><th></th></tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>-eq</code></td>
          <td>Equivalence Class</td>
          <td>
            Represents equivalence classes of variables and constants.
            It uses a naïve implementation of union find and partition
            refinement to implement basic domain operations.  It is
            implemented in the following file:<br/>
            <code>~/set_analysis/src/EqClassDomain.ml</code>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>-oct</code></td>
          <td>Octagon</td>
          <td>
            This is the APRON abstract domain for octagons.  Octagons
            represent constraints of the form ±x±y±c≤0 where x and y
            are variables and c is a constant.  It is implemented in
            the following file: <br/>
            <code>~/set_analysis/src/ApronDomain.ml</code>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>-poly</code></td>
          <td>Octagon</td>
          <td>
            This is the APRON abstract domain for octagons.  Octagons
            represent constraints of the form ±x±y±c≤0 where x and y
            are variables and c is a constant.  It is implemented in
            the following file: <br/>
            <code>~/set_analysis/src/ApronDomain.ml</code>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>Note that all available abstract domains are relational.
      This implementation of QUIC graphs relies upon relations in the
      scalar domain to perform reductions.  The domain is sound
      without a relational scalar domain, but it loses most
      precision.</p>

      <h3>Analyzing Copy Using a Polyhedron-based Scalar Domain</h3>

      <p>
        Run the this basic analysis using the following command:
      </p>

      <code>$ ../Main –poly copy.js0</code>

      <p>
        This will run the analysis on the copy program, attempting to
        prove assertions present in the program.  It will also produce
        auxiliary files showing the generated invariants at many
        program points in the intermediate language.  They are most
        easily viewed in the generated HTML file:
      </p>

      <code>$ firefox copy.html</code>

      <p>
        This shows the set and numeric constraints generated
        throughout the program in red.
      </p>

      <h3>Analyzing Copy Using an Equivalence Class Scalar Domain</h3>

      <p>
        Identical to the polyhedron-based analysis, run the analysis
        using an equivalence class domain:
      </p>
      
      <code>$ ../Main –eq copy.js0</code>

      <p>
        Because the QUIC graph domain is constructed on the fly, it
        can easily be switched to this simpler domain that is not part
        of the APRON library.  Similarly this domain is sufficient to
        prove all properties in this program, so the output is empty.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Analyzing Filter</h3>

      <p>
        The filter program is like the copy program except that it
        does not copy every element.  It only copies the elements
        greater than 10 and less than or equal to 11.  This may seem
        like a trivial program, but it allows us to state an invariant
        at the end of the program that is expressible in both the
        polyhedron domain and in the equivalence class
        domain. However, because we used inequalities in the
        specification of the filter, the equivalence class domain
        loses too much information about what is in the set to prove
        the second property.  Note that it can still prove that the
        result set r is a subset of the input set s:
      </p>

      <code>$ ../Main –eq filter.js0</code>

      <p>
        Now we see that a property could not be proven.  This is due
        to the imprecision of the equivalence class abstract domain.
        This is because elements that are included are those greater
        than 10 and less than or equal to 11, which is not
        representable using equivalence classes.  However polyhedrons
        can represent this fact:
      </p>

      <code>$ ../Main –poly filter.js0</code>

      <p>
        If we view the generate invariants, we see that they are quite
        complex:
      </p>

      <code>$ firefox filter.html</code>

      <p>
        This complexity comes from history variables and variables
        introduced by converting the program to A-normal form.  If we
        look for critical facts, such as r ⊆ {ω ∈ s | ω &gt; 10 ∧ ω ≤
        11} are represented in the constraints where the verification
        happens.
      </p>

      <h3>Running Benchmarks</h3>

      <p>
        The benchmarks and many other sample programs are contained in
        a different directory:
      </p>

      <code>$ cd ~/set_analysis/test.js0</code>

      <p>
        They are written in a special language for encoding set
        constraints.  Some of the programs have been translated from
        functions in the python test suite with the matching name.
        Others are adapted from the python test suite:
      </p>

      <table border>
        <tr>
          <td><code>./factored_original/*</code></td>
          <td>
            Programs adapted directly from the Python test suite.
            They are typically finite state.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>./factored_nondet/*</code></td>
          <td>
            Modified programs from the Python test suite.  They have
            been modified to make them more generic.  They are
            typically infinite state.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>./other_tests/*</code></td>
          <td>
            Simple sanity check tests 
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>./*</code></td>
          <td>
            A variety of tests developed over the course of the
            project; some before and some after publication.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        The tests from the paper can be run using
        the <code>./run_tests.sh</code> script.  The results are in
        the various log files generated for each benchmark run.
