    <h1>Run-time Compilation Techniques to Enable Multi-Core Systems</h1>

Emerging multi-core processor designs create a new, unparalleled
computing paradigm capable of advancing scientific areas, including
medicine, data mining, biology, physics, and earth sciences.  These
designs are the cornerstone of all future general-purpose and
high-performance computing systems.  However, a crisis is developing
because the trends in hardware technology have advanced far ahead of
the advances in software technology.  Performance improvements will
only be possible with advances in software to fully utilize the
multi-core hardware.  Realizing the full potential of future
multi-core machines in the presence of emerging trends in power/energy
control, temperature regulation, and transistor reliability requires a
run-time compilation system capable of adapting thread-level behavior
to changing applications needs as well as the execution environment
change.  We examine several characteristics and services enabled by a
multi-core run-time compilation system. The highlights of the system
include the construction of a run-time system approach to transient
fault tolerance and the development of an on-line performance modeling
and profiling framework for directing multi-core resource allocation
and optimization.
