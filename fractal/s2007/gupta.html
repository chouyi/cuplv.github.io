    <h1>De-con-struction of the Polyhedral Model</h1>


The Polyhedral Model has been extensively used for the analysis and
transformation of regular loop programs. In my talk, I'll contrive
some examples that explain the motivations for the development of the
model.  Using the properties of the model, I will elaborate on (i) the
correctness of transformations and analyses (in other words, why
everything works the way it seems to work), and (ii) the design of an
equational language based on the model. Then the talk will present
compelling reasons for "de-struction" of the polyhedral model.
