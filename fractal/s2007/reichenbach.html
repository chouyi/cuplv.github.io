    <h1>Guided Refactorings</h1>

Refactoring is the process of transforming a program into a
structurally different program with the same behaviour.  Most modern
software development tools include refactoring support, but are
inconvenient in one of two ways: Either they perform more
transformations than requested, or they refuse some desirable
transformations.  We present a novel approach to refactoring which
suffers from neither limitation.
