    <h1>Development Support for Concurrent Threaded Pipelining</h1>

Single-core performance increases have stalled. To increase available
cycles, microprocessor designers have shifted to chip-multiprocessor
(CMP) designs. These designs will provide tens to hundreds of
processing cores per system that may be asymmetric in performance and
heterogeneous in capability. Harnessing these resources is critical as
these cores may individually be less powerful than existing single
core solutions. Unfortunately, the additional cores provided by CMPs
may remain idle because most applications lack data-parallelism and
task-parallelism is unlikely to saturate future CMP designs. The
systems community needs to rethink how software is developed to fully
utilize CMPs.
<p>
We propose that programming languages and system libraries be extended
to explicitly support Concurrent Threaded Pipeline (pipeline-
parallel) organizations. Pipeline-parallel organizations differ from
traditional data- and task-parallelism in that most inter-data
dependencies are automatically handled. However, harnessing any
potential performance improvements requires careful management of the
underlying computer architecture to achieve the necessary core-to-
core communication performance. In this talk we will discuss the
potential performance improvements of Concurrent Threaded Pipelining
and the language support necessary to support it at both the compiler
and programmer levels.
