    <h1>Reversed-Height Scheduling for SMT Network Processors</h1>

The internet usage grows very fast nowadays. As the number of internet
users grows, so are the demands for a higher performance and a higher
quality of service. Various forms of so-called network processors have
been proposed and built to meet these demands.  Network processors are
those that are optimized for various network loads. In this paper, we
present an instruction scheduling algorithm for SMT(Simultaneous
Multithreading) machines based on reversed-heights. SMT is one of the
promising architectures for network processors, but we need a careful
code scheduling to maximize its performance. A reversed-height of an
instruction is defined as the latest time this instruction can be
scheduled without delaying the critical path of the program. By trying
to schedule instructions as close as possible to their corresponding
reversed-heights, we can obtain an efficient schedule for SMT
machines. We have implemented our algorithm on GCC, have applied it to
an example network workload -- IP packet forwarding code -- to show
its effectiveness.
