    <h1>Finding Large-scale Parallelism using BDDs</h1>

Recently, difficulties in managing power consumption, wire delays and
design complexity have forced designers to shift from faster
uni-processor designs to chip multiprocessors (CMPs).  Unfortunately,
CMPs require programmers to expose thread-level parallelism to
continue the performance scaling previously provided by faster
hardware.  However, parallel programs are notoriously difficult to
develop and debug.<p>

This talk will present an approach to examining the dynamic execution
of sequential applications to find opportunities for construction of
parallel codes.  A key challenge in this work is representing the
relationships between computations in the dynamic trace; consider that
a dynamic trace data set may contain billions of members.  Worse,
data-dependence visualization, program slicing, and variable liveness
techniques (all important for finding parallelism) require global
access to this data.  This talk will discuss the novel observation
that traces stored as Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) are compact and
can be analyzed so that the analysis has complexity that is a function
of the compressed size.  The talk will discuss how to represent trace
data in BDD form and how this data can be used for global analysis and
visualization.
