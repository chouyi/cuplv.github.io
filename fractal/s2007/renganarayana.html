    <h1>Posynomials and Optimal Tiling : A Positive Match!</h1>

Optimal tiling---selecting the "best" tile sizes---is an important and
well widely studied problem in high performance parallel as well as
sequential implementations. Though widely studied, current solutions
suffer from two important limitations (i) Inextensibility---solution
methods are strongly coupled to the cost models and any extensions to
cost models make the solution inapplicable; (ii) Scalability---the
solutions address only a single-level of tiling and do not scale to
multiple levels of tiling.

Based on the fundamental mathematical properties of the functions used
in optimal tiling models, we propose a framework which provides an
extensible as well as scalable solution to the optimal tiling
problem. Our framework is made of two components: a modeling formalism
based on a special class of polynomials called posynomials and a
generic convex optimization solver.  The former is used for specifying
optimal tiling models and the later is used as single generic solution
method.  We have successfully reduced optimal tiling models proposed
by different authors for a variety tiling contexts---parallelism,
caches, registers---into models in our framework.
