    <h1>Representation-Independent Alias Analysis and Data-Flow Analysis</h1>

Program analysis is necessary in many application domains including
software engineering, high performance computing, scientific
computing, data mining, and operating systems.  However, reusing
analysis implementations is difficult because they are typically
coupled to a particular intermediate representation (IR).  The
OpenAnalysis toolkit separates analysis from the intermediate
representation of the program.  In this talk I will present our
progress in developing language-independent alias analysis and general
data-flow analysis while maintaining a direct mapping to the original
IR for the program.
