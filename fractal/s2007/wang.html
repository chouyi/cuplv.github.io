    <h1>Runtime Analysis of Concurrency Errors for Multithreaded Programs</h1>

Multithreading has become a common programming technique. However,
concurrency introduces the possibility of errors that do not exist in
sequential programs. Data races and deadlocks are well-known
concurrency errors. Atomicity violation is another important kind of
concurrency defect that is not yet as well known and deeply studied.
Atomicity is a higher-level correctness condition for concurrent
systems. Informally, a code block is atomic if every execution of the
program is equivalent to an execution in which that code block
executes without interruption by other threads. Tools that
automatically detect violations of atomicity can uncover subtle errors
that are hard to find with traditional debugging and testing
techniques.

I will present a tool that can detect deadlocks, data races, and
atomicity violations efficiently and accurately. The tool found many
subtle and previously unreported concurrency errors in the Sun JDK and
other programs. In this talk, I will focus on an algorithm for runtime
(dynamic) detection of violations of conflict-atomicity and
view-atomicity, which are analogous to conflict-serializability and
view-serializability in database systems. In the algorithm, the
recorded events are formed into a graph with edges representing the
synchronization within each transaction and possible interactions
between transactions. We give conditions on the graph that imply
conflict-atomicity and view-atomicity. Experiments show that the
algorithm is more efficient in most experiments and is more accurate
than previous algorithms with comparable asymptotic complexity.
