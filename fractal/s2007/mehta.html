    <h1>Chip Floorplanning</h1>

Floorplanning is a step in VLSI design that determines locations of
components on a chip based on criteria that have traditionally
included chip area and interconnect length. Floorplanning is
increasingly becoming relevant during architectural design because
component locations impact interconnect delays, which in turn, impact
clock frequency. This talk describes our research in floorplanning and
outlines some challenges for the future.
