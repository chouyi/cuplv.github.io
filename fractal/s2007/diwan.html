    <h1>Aligning traces for performance evaluation</h1> 

Architects commonly use traces containing hardware and software
metrics to understand performance.  Unfortunately, it is not feasible
to collect all metrics in a single trace.  For example, modern
processors can collect hundreds of distinct hardware events, but they
can collect only a few at a time, requiring multiple runs to collect
all the metrics.  Unfortunately there is enough non-determinism, even
in carefully controlled experiments, that we cannot immediately reason
across traces from different runs: instead we need to align the traces
before we can reason across them.  This paper describes and evaluates
techniques for aligning traces.

Our trace alignment techniques enable performance analysts to safely
and effectively reason across traces.  We evaluate two different
alignment techniques: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Full Uniform
Scaling (FUS), and demonstrate that DTW consistently outperforms FUS.
To align two traces, DTW requires at least one metric (the alignment
metric) common to both traces.  We demonstrate that the choice of
alignment metric is critical to the performance of DTW.  We introduce
and evaluate two novel techniques for picking a good alignment metric.
Both techniques significantly outperform a carefully, but manually,
picked alignment metric.  Finally, we describe a novel criteria which
indicates a priori whether nor not DTW will yield a good alignment.
