    <h1>Facilitating communication between program analyses</h1>

Different program analyses work best on different program
representations.  However, using a traditional approach it is
difficult to use different IRs in a single system as exchanging
information is not possible without significant manual work. This
forces programmers to compromise on a single IR, thereby degrading
analyses. We present a method for synthesizing IRs from specifications
while automatically providing communication between the different IRs.
