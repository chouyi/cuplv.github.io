    <h1>Characterization of Inter-Process Interference in Multithreaded and Multicore Architectures</h1> 
<p>
As the problems of power, heat, and design complexity limit the
potential of traditional, single-context designs, modern computer
architectures increasingly depend on multicore and various types of
multithreading to achieve higher process throughput.  However, the
effectiveness of such designs is in large part dependent on
inter-process interference, the competition between processes for
shared resources.  Characterizing this interference is a multifaceted
problem which requires a combination of approaches.  Traditional
analysis techniques are inadequate for these systems as the
prohibitive number of combinations of program behaviors, and therefore
interference patterns in addition to a larger design space.  This talk
will discuss a comprehensive system consisting of a program co-phase
guided sampled simulation technique, modeling techniques using neural
networks, and a mathematical model for determining the contribution of
co-phases to overall program behavior.
