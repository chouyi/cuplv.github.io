    <h1>Generation of Pointer Cognizant Data-Flow Analyses From Succinct Specifications</h1> 
<p>
Data-flow analysis is a commonly used technique to gather program
information for register allocation and important code transformations
such dead-code elimination, common sub expression elimination, and
scheduling.  Frameworks for easing the implementation of data-flow
analyses and transformations remove the need for the implementer to
iterate over the statements in the program, but still require the user
to implement details regarding the affects of aliasing, side effects,
arrays, and user-defined structures.

We are developing a tool DFAGen (Data-flow Analyzer Generator), which
generates implementations for locally separable (e.g. bit-vector)
data-flow analyses that are, pointer, side-effect, and aggregate
cognizant from an analysis specification that assumes only scalars.
Analysis specifications are typically eight lines long and similar to
those in standard compiler textbooks.
