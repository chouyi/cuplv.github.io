    <h1>Reordering Irregular Meshes for Improved Data Locality: So many heuristics, So little time</h1> 
<p>
Optimizing codes that involve irregular data access patterns to
improve data locality is crucial due to their use in an increasing
number of scientific and engineering appli- cations. Todays computing
architectures are experiencing an increasing gap between CPU speed and
memory speed demanding that applications pay attention to data access
patterns in order to maintain peak performance. Codes that involve
irregular or spatially disjoint access patterns must be reordered to
achieve acceptable performance. Reorder- ing transformations on the
iteration and data spaces improve memory access patterns for data
locality. These optimizations allow the applications to achieve finer
resolution and greater accuracy bringing them closer the simulation
goals. A one heuristic fits all strategy does not always produce the
best performance for all inputs. We propose a framework for selecting
a reordering heuristics at runtime based on mesh features.  A database
will be available with performance metrics for mesh signatures that
span the feature space. For a given mesh, we compute a variety of mesh
features to form a signature that is queried against the database. We
then return a reordering heuristic appropriate for that mesh.
