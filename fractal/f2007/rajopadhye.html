    <h1>GRAIL: A Generic Reconfigurable Affine Interconnection Lattice</h1> 
<p>
Affine control loops (ACLs) constitute an important class of
compute and data intensive programs. Domain specific SIMD
architectures are an attractive target for direct hardware
implementation of such programs.  This compilation requires, in the
most general case, interconnections which (i) are affine functions of
the PEs and (ii) change dynamically with program execution. We
propose a reconfigurable, on-chip, interconnection network, called
GRAIL, that supports such temporally changing affine interconnections
through constant time reconfiguration. It is generic in the sense
that the same fabric can be (re)used to support any affine
communication pattern. The GRAIL may be viewed as a non-blocking
circuit-switched multistage interconnection network that has an
attractive cost-connectivity tradeoff vis-a-vis traditional networks.
We describe the properties of interconnections realized by a GRAIL,
and show how the switch settings as well as the dynamic
reconfigurations can be determined systematically.
