    <h1>Smashing Periodic Domains</h1> 
<p>
Tiling is an effective tool for improving temporal and spacial data
reuse, but periodic domains are hard to effectively tile. Modeling
hollow objects such as a ring, cylinder, torus, or sphere creates
periodic domains.  Since they are just shells, they can be expressed
using one less dimen- sion than that in which they exist. This break
down is typically done by cutting the object and unrolling it. The top
and bottom points of these un- rolled objects are still
neighbors. This creates domains with wrap-around dependences that are
long and in almost opposite directions in the itera- tion space
limiting the tiling options. We propose a method for dealing with this
problem. Our solution involves treating the object as the original
round object it represents and then removing the unnecessary dimension
by flattening or smashing, it instead of unrolling it. This flattening
allows the removal of a dimension without creating wrap-around, thus
enabling more tiling options.
