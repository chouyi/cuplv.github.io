    <h1>Mallice - A Computer Memory Fragmentation Analysis Tool</h1> 
<p>
Applications often request significantly more memory from the operating
system than what is actually needed to store the data of the application.
Such inefficient use of memory degenerates system performance (by making
caching on all levels less effective). Total memory consumption can also be
crucial factor in terms of battery life and overall hardware cost for
embedded systems.  Reducing inefficiencies in memory utilization by
applications thus holds the promise of significantly improving application
performance and reducing system costs.
</p>
<p>
Inefficient use of memory by applications can have a multitude of causes;
the dominant causes are internal memory management overheads and memory
fragmentation. Fragmentation becomes problematic when applications generate
many unused, discontinuous memory areas (fragments) which are too small to
be re-used for larger allocation requests.  Manually optimizing programs to
reduce memory management overheads and fragmentation is a major challenge
beyond the abilities of most developers.  The reason for this is that the
program statements causing fragmentation cannot be identified by simple code
inspection.  Furthermore, the causes for fragmentation are likely to be
widely dispersed throughout the code, with no one statement being the cause
of a particular fragment. In all cases fragmentation is a product of
multiple statements in code that, when executed in sequence, cause the
introduction of a new fragment.
</p>
<p>
In order to address this issue, we are implementing a new memory analysis
tool called "Mallice", which helps software engineers to detect and analyze
the causes of application-level fragmentation in computer memory.  An
important challenge in this context is to avoid changes to the application
behavior due to the presence of the analyzer.  As a result, Mallice is not
allowed to perform any dynamic memory allocations as part of the process
that is being analyzed.  Our approach is to intercept all memory requests
and transmit the event sequence for analysis to a different process.
