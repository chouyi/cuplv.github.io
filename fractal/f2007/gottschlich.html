    <h1>Characterizing Optimization Potential in Lock-based Software Transactional Memory</h1> 
<p>
Transactional memory (TM) is a recently developed parallel programming
mechanism which reduces the complexity of multi-threaded programming by
moving thread coordination and memory synchronization into a system
infrastructure. TM systems implement their underlying memory synchronization
by using either (1) non-blocking atomic primitives, such as compare-and-swap
(CAS) or (2) lock-based synchronization mechanisms, such as mutex locks.
Previous lock-based direct updating software transactional memory (STM)
systems have been shown to outperform non-blocking deferred updating STM
systems. Conclusions are then presented stating lock-based systems
outperform non-blocking systems due to direct updating, which naturally
optimizes the common transactional commit case and reduces cache misses.
</p>
<p>
Our STM system, DracoSTM, the first lock-based system to implement both
direct updating and deferred updating, shows that deferred updating
outperforms direct updating in most cases, except highly innately parallel
data structures. Through careful analysis of three variably performing data
structures, we explain the underlying foundational differences causing
transactional performance variation within these data structures. Our
findings prompt new questions regarding parallel algorithms and complexity
analysis, especially concerning optimization potential. We show that neither
direct or deferred updating perform optimally for all data structures, but,
counter intuitively, deferred updating tends to perform better especially
when coupled with commit-time invalidation. Our findings give new
theoretical and practical performance foundations in which to consider
direct and deferred updating in lock-based STM systems. These findings
suggest that other lock-based STM systems should also implement both direct
and deferred updating strategies.
