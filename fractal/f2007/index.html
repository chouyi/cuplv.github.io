<h3>Time, Location and Directions</h3>
<p>
The workshop will be at the University of Colorado at Boulder on
October 14, 2007.  The workshop will be in the Bechtel Collaboratory
in the Discovery Learning Center (DLC), a building adjoining the
Engineering Center.  Breakfast begins at 8:30am, a tentative schedule
is below.

The Bechtel Collaboratory is room 1B70 in the <a
href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/department/maps/dlc1b.html">Discovery
learning center</a> on the University of Colorado at Boulder's campus
on the corner of Regent Dr. and Colorado Ave in Boulder, CO.

<ul>
<li><b>From the North</b> - Take I-25 South to Exit 240.  Exit onto
CO-119 W toward Longmont.  Turn right at CO-119 (aka Diagonal
Highway).  After about 18 miles on 119, exit onto CO-157 South (aka
Foothills Parkway).  Foothills crosses Arapahoe at a traffic light.
Go through this light and make a right at Colorado Avenue, which is
the next traffic light.  On Colorado, pass by East Campus on your
right, cross 30th street, 28th street, and then make a left onto
Regent Drive.  Park in the large parking lot or parking deck on your
left (known collectively as Lot 436).  The Discovery Learning Center
is the building directly across the large parking lot.  The building
entrace is on the right just underneath the footbridge running
parallel to Regent Drive.</li>

<li><b>From the South</b> - Take I-25 North to Exit 217.  Exit at exit
217 onto US 36 North.  Continue on US 36 for about 20 miles.  Make a
left on Colorado Ave.  Make the next left onto Regent Drive.  Park in
the large parking lot or parking deck on your left (known collectively
as Lot 436).  The Discovery Learning Center is the building directly
across the large parking lot.  The building entrace is on the right
just underneath the footbridge running parallel to Regent Drive.</li>
</ul>
