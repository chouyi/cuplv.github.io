    <h1>Synthesis from Linear-Time Specifications</h1>
<p>
Game theoretic approaches to synthesis of controllers have been
explored for over twenty years, but practical applications are only
now emerging.
</p>
<p>
In this talk we review some classic results and recent advances, and
show how they may be combined to translate a set of linear time
properties (typically given in LTL) into an implementation.
</p>
<p>
We discuss some preliminary results.
