    <h1>Managing Perturbation</h1> 
<p>
Whenever we measure a computer system, we perturb its behavior.  This
perturbation has the potential to drastically affect our understanding
of the system's behavior.
</p>
<p>
This talk describes a methodology for detecting perturbation and
applies it to two different measurement approaches: (i) overall
profiles, which measure end-to-end performance (e.g., total number of
cache misses) and (ii) temporal correlations between performance
metrics (e.g., correlation of IPC and cache misses).  Using the SPEC
CPU2006 CINT benchmarks, we explore how the various parameters of
these two approaches impact perturbation.  Our results show that for
either of these approaches even a small measurement overhead (e.g.,
less than 2% increase in instruction count) can drastically perturb a
system.
