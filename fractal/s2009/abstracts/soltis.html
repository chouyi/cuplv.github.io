    <h1> Multicore Architecture Challenges </h1>

    <h1> Don Soltis (Intel Corporation) Keynote - Fractal Workshop 2009  </h1>


<b> Abstract </b>
As server processors are delivering increased core counts there are several
software, system and architectural issues that need to be addressed
to maximize performance and flexibility, particularly in the future. 
Today's 4 processor systems closely resemble yesterdays large scale-out systems;
however, core to core communication latency disparity is increasing between
local and remote cores.

<br>

System performance on multi-core processors can be scaled horizontally by increasing the number of applications running on a system or scaled vertically
by breaking down applications into multiple threads. Additionally, at some point both techniques will be applied within a system.
The application environment will generally trend toward increased competition among applications for processor and system resources.  System constraints around power and volumetrics limit cache and memory capacity and bandwidth.  Continued research in the core-cache-memory architectures, topologies and
software innovations will enable performance growth of multi-core systems.

<b>Biograph </b>

 Don is a Sr. Principal Engineer at Intel currently working on the design of the
next generation Itanium CPU, code named Poulson.  He has worked on Itanium CPU
design and architecture for 12 years.  In his spare time he particularly enjoys fly
fishing the Colorado Rockies streams and lakes for trout and the southwest Florida
coastline for Tarpon, Snook and Redfish.
