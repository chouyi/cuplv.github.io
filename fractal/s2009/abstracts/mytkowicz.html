Abstract:
Runtime measurements of program performance are useful for both
program understanding and optimization.  Most approaches that collect
runtime information employ an active approach---they add
instrumentation to a program in order to calculate a metric of
interest at runtime (e.g.  caller-callee relationships in gprof).
This type of measurement is limited in that (i) in many cases it
requires the source of a program in order to add instrumentation and
(ii) it alters the program's memory layout which may drastically alter
the behavior of the program we are measuring.
<br>

In this talk we collect rich runtime information without instrumenting
the binary.  Specifically, we illustrate a passive approach to
building calling context profiles.  With passive measurement we
innocuously observe certain aspects of a running program and then use
those observations to infer runtime characteristics of the program.
This technique does not require the source of a program nor does it
alter the static memory layout of the program, thereby circumventing
the two issues above.

<br>
We conclude by exploring the effectiveness of our passive calling
context profiler on the 2006 SPEC C/C++ benchmark suite.
