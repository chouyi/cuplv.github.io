Tiling Visualizer is a tool written in Java which helps to visualize rectangular tilings of 2-dimensional 
loops bounded by polyhedra.  Tiling is a loop transformation that modifies the loops schedule for 
improved data locality and to expose large-grained parallelism.  Previously visualizations of loop 
tilings were static illustrations drawn by hand, and every time an adjustment was needed, the image had 
to be redrawn laboriously.  With this tool, there is now an automated process for creating pdf images 
for talks and papers used to illustrate tiling in a classroom setting.  In thisthrough a brief tutorial on the use of the Tiling Visualizer.
