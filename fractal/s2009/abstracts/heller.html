    <h1> NCAR Weather and Climate Code Optimized on Nvidia CUDA</h1>

A demonstration of impressive speedups of Fortran weather code using  
off-the-shelf PC graphics cards.  Critical portions of NCAR's  
(National Center for Atmospheric Research) WRF weather code were  
ported to Nvidia's CUDA architecture, achieving a performance gain of  
close to 500X relative to the CPU, on a single consumer PC containing  
dual Nvidia 9800GX2 cards.

<br>
The parallelization which achieves this gain is achieved at several  
levels of granularity.  Coarse grained parallelism is architected  
across a two dimensional geographic grid representing the earth's  
surface.  Speedup at this level scales nearly linearly with the number  
of multiprocessors in the system.  In addition to the coarse grained X- 
Y parallelism, the code is organized fine grained parallel along the Z- 
axis, and distributed amongst individual processors within each  
multiprocessor, corresponding to layers of the atmosphere.
<br>
There is very little algorithmic communication per time step required  
between computational nodes, allowing for the majority of local  
variables to be stored in single-cycle hardware registers.  The  
minimal memory traffic makes possible very high performance and  
scalable computing.  Preliminary experiments have also been performed  
on NCAR climate code, and similar speedups are expected.
