<b> Abstract </b>


Single-threaded and low-thread-count computational performance has reached a
plateau.  It is widely recognized that future performance improvements will come
from massively parallel systems.  Several different parallel processing models have
been proposed; most have failed.  This session explores NVIDIA's CUDA proposals and
explains their success factors via several case studies.
