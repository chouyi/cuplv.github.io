With advances in hardware, instruction set architectures are
undergoing continual evolution.  As a result, compilers are under
constant pressure to adapt and take full advantage of available
features.  However, current techniques for evaluating compiler output
only compare profiles at the application level, ignoring relative
performance differences at finer granularities.  To ensure new
features are put to good use, a more rigorous approach is necessary.
A fundamental step in tuning compiler performance is identifying the
specific examples that can be improved.  To solve this problem, we
present a compiler-independent binary matching technique to compare
executions of differently compiled programs and identify intervals
where the behavior can be meaningfully compared.  Matched intervals
can be automatically analyzed to identify anomalous segments of
execution where one version performs significantly differently versus
another.  We present a case studies using Chainsaw to identify
significant performance anomalies between differently compiled codes.
