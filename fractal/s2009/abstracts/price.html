    <h1>Reducing BDD Creation Time for Dynamic Trace Information</h1>


Presenter: Graham Price

<br>
Dynamic program analysis can aid the development of parallel codes.  
However, dynamic
analyses often use collections of trace information that can exceed  
gigabytes in size. It
is possible to make dynamic trace information space efficient, and  
useful for a variety of
analyses, by utilizing reduced, ordered binary decision diagrams  
(BDDs). A BDD
representation can store sets of states with a size that depends more  
on the amount of
similarity between states than the number of represented states.  
Dynamic trace
information, in tuple form, often contains similar states and can be  
efficiently
represented by BDDs. Unfortunately, creating a BDD representation of  
trace data
generally takes many hours. This is due, in part, to the overhead cost  
of memory
management.
<br>

This talk will present a technique that can reduce the amount of  
memory allocated and
freed during BDD creation, and therefore reduce creation time. A  
common BDD creation
method for sets of integers, as well as trace tuples, initially builds  
a BDD that represents
the identity function of each trace tuple member. This BDD is then  
disjoined with
another BDD that represents all tuples that have been previously  
extracted from the
dynamic trace. The result of this operation is a new up-to-date BDD.  
Both operand
BDDs used in the disjunction operation are then marked for garbage  
collection. This
process, including BDD memory allocation and deletion, is repeated for  
every tuple in the
dynamic trace.

<br>
This talk will discuss a possible alternative technique based on the  
idea that a trace BDD
can be formed by combining small, identical, regions of variables from  
each tuple in the
trace. During the process of forming a BDD for each new region it is  
combined with prior
regions, ultimately resulting a a single complete trace BDD. This  
technique does not
create a new BDD for each tuple member, and therefore has the  
potential to reduce
memory management costs. This talk will conclude with a discussion of  
technique
implementations, including a "brute-force'' method and a pre-pass sort  
algorithm.
