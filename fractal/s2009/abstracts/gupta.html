    <h1> The COREquations Engine: Tools for HPC</h1>

  We will describe and demonstrate a tool that produces optimized  
programs starting with specifications in "scientific notation" such as  
mathematical equations. Formal methods are used to check the  
specification for completeness and consistency, as a result, the  
generated code is correct-by-construction, e.g., it is guaranteed to  
be free of out-of-bounds accesses.
Typically weeks, or a few months are spent in the performance tuning  
of scientific kernels exploring design choices such as memory  
alignments, iteration order and tile shape and size selection. We will  
demonstrate how our high level tool provides inexpensive design space  
exploration through single-line commands for program transformations.  
Our automation of loop fusion and fission also provides performance  
gains over hand-optimization (which is limited by the users' capacity  
for exhausting all possibilities). As a case study, we will present  
performance gains of using our tool over hand tuning of some stencil  
codes that arise in Atmospheric Science (shallow water models).
We currently generate MPI for small clusters as well as (tiled)  
optimized sequential code. If there is time, we will describe some  
choices that went into the MPI code generator.
