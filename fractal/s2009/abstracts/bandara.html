Many emerging Distributed Collaborative Adaptive Sensing (DCAS) systems rely on 
sensing, processing, and storage nodes interconnected via the Internet. Collaborative Adaptive 
Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) is such a DCAS system that interconnects array of weather 
radars, processing elements, and end users that generate, transmit, and process high-bandwidth 
data streams. Adapting to varying network conditions is a major challenge in these mission 
critical distributed systems. In addition to high-speed and real-time communication requirements, 
many DCAS end users rely on different subsets of data generated by the same set of sensing 
nodes. Quality of Services (QoS) perceived by end users depends on the timeliness and 
usefulness of the received data hence jitter, excessive delay, and random loss of packets are not 
desirable. Conventional end-host based correction and adaptation techniques that try to overcome 
network dynamics are not generally successful, and varying user interests on data makes the 
problem more complex. In contrast, Application-Aware Overlay Networks (AWON) have the 
potential to significantly enhance the QoS, by adapting the packet forwarding strategy based on 
the application requirements. With overlay networking, application-aware processing and storage 
can be implemented at intermediate nodes, thus enhancing the adaptability of the application to 
varying network conditions and improving QoS provided to the end users. For example, an 
application-aware overlay-forwarding node can drop packets deterministically during congestion 
so that the application can still receive the subset of data that is critical to its correct 
functionality.

We present Application-Aware Overlay Networks (AWON) architecture [1] for 
deploying application-aware services in overlay networks (Figure 1). Application-specific 
Service Plug-ins (ASPs) are used to inject application specific functionality into the overlay 
nodes. ASPs may be deployed online or offline and may belong to different applications. An 
Application Programming Interface (API) is further developed to ease the deployment of ASPs 
within the AWON architectural framework. The architecture and API allow the applications to 
regulate the flow of data through the overlay nodes by extracting, selecting, fusing, and 
repacking data while taking application specific constrains into account. The API also enables 
the communication between the ASPs and the underlying overlay routing protocol for the desired 
QoS support. For example, a plug-in may inform the routing layer its desired bandwidth and 
latency requirements so that the most favorable node that may lead to a better route is selected as 
the next-hop. Our architectural framework further supports the concurrent execution of plug-ins 
and interconnection between them. We demonstrated a real-time, weather radar data 
dissemination system to illustrate the efficacy of AWON and the API. Experimentations on 
PlanetLab show that AWON based application-aware services significantly improve the quality 
of content delivered to the end users under varying network conditions.
