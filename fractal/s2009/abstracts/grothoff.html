    <h1> Productive Parallel Programming for the Masses</h1>



Presenter: Christian Grothoff
<br>
This talk introduces the DUP System, a simple framework for parallel
stream processing.  The DUP System enables developers to compose
applications from stages written in almost any programming language
and to run distributed streaming applications across all
POSIX-compatible platforms.  Parallel applications written with the
DUP System do not suffer from many of the problems that exist in
traditional parallel languages.  The DUP System includes a range of
simple stages that serve as general-purpose building blocks for larger
applications.
<br>
This work describes the DUP coordination language, the DUP
architecture and some of the stages included in the DUP System,
illustrating their use with a simple example of a parallel prime number
generator.
