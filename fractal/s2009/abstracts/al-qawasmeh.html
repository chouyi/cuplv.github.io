Abstract: Distributed and cluster computing systems are often heterogeneous computing (HC) systems 
consisting of machines with diverse capabilities harnessed together to execute a set of tasks (i.e., workload) 
that vary in their computational requirements. An HC system can be characterized using an Estimated Time 
to Compute (ETC) matrix. Each value in this matrix represents the ETC of a specific task on a specific 
machine when executed exclusively. Heuristics use the values in the ETC matrix to allocate tasks to 
machines in the HC system. The performance of resource allocation heuristics can be affected significantly 
by factors such as task and machine heterogeneities. Therefore, quantifying heterogeneity will allow a 
system to select a heuristic appropriate for the given heterogeneous environment. In this paper, we identify 
different central moments used to quantify the heterogeneity of ETC matrices obtained from real world 
systems and benchmark data, and show the effect of these moments on the performance of heuristics both 
through simple examples and simulations.
