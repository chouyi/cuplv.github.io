<br>
Software systems typically exploit only a small fraction of the
realizable performance from the underlying microprocessors. While
there has been much work on hardware-aware optimizations, two factors
limit their benefit. First, microprocessors are so complex that it is
unlikely that even an aggressively optimizing compiler will be able to
satisfy all the constraints necessary to obtain the best performance.
Thus, most optimizations use a simplified model of the hardware (e.g.,
they may be cache-aware but they may ignore other hardware structures,
such as TLBs, etc.). Second, hardware manufacturers do not reveal all
details of their microprocessors so even if the authors of
optimizations want to simultaneously optimize for all components of
the hardware, they may be unable to do so because they are working
with limited knowledge. This paper presents and evaluates our blind
optimization approach which provides a way to circumvent these issues.
<br>
Blind optimization uses the insight that we can generate many variants
of an application by altering semantic preserving parameters of an
application; for example our variants can cover the space of code and
data layout by shifting the positions of code and data in memory, or
by inverting conditional branches. Our optimization strategy attempts
to find a variant that performs well with respect to an optimization
objective. We show that even our first implementation of blind
optimization speeds up a number of programs from the SPECint 2006
benchmark suite.
