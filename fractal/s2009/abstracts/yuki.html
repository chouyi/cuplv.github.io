It has been known that some classes of important scientific computations can be 
expressed as a system of equations. The polyhedral model is one approach to reason 
about such class of programs, and many important compiler optimizations, such as 
loop interchange, fusion, fission, tiling can be expressed in the model. There are a 
number of tools available that utilizes the polyhedral model to generate efficient code. 
Equations by themselves are sufficient to express the computations that needs to be 
performed, but there are three missing pieces in order to generate efficient parallel 
code from equations. The three pieces are schedule, processor allocation, and memory 
allocation. This paper presents a method to verify the legality of the three pieces given 
for an equational programming language Alphabets. 

<br>
The verifier is implemented as part of the AlphaZ system, a system around Alpha- 
bets to perform analysis, transformation, and code generation. Given the verifier, the 
user can verify the schedules, processor allocation, and memory allocation they have 
given, and will be able to identify where the test failed in case what they have given was 
illegal. This is a powerful tool for both manual and automated exploration of design 
space.
