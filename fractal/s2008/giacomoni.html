    <h1>Supporting Fine-grain TLP with Selective Timesharing</h1>

The industry wide shift to parallel architectures is a serious problem
for sequential applications. Application developers can no longer rely
on increases in transistor count and fabrication technology to
increase performance without their intervention.  The question today
is, "how do we continue to increase the performance of sequential
applications on parallel platforms?" We believe that fine-grain thread
level parallelism (TLP) is a viable approach for many applications on
general-purpose multicore/multiprocessor machines given: 1) a low
overhead software-only core-to-core communication primitive (our
previous work), and 2) the ability to control timing jitter between
threads.  (In this context, we operationally define fine-grain TLP as
0.5 to 5 times the overhead of an empty interrupt handler per
unit-of-work, e.g., approximately 100-1000 nanoseconds).
<p>
Under reasonable loads interrupts, including non-I/O interrupts, were
found to have an observable effect on user-space applications
implementing fine-grain TLP.  This talk presents our initial work on
using Selective Timesharing to control operating system related jitter
thereby allowing for the effective use of fine-grain TLP without
sacrificing the benefits of a general purpose parallel processing
platform.
