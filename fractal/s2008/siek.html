    <h1>Build to Order Linear Algebra Kernels</h1>

The performance bottleneck for many scientific applications is the
cost of memory access inside linear algebra kernels. Tuning such
kernels for memory efficiency is a complex task that reduces the
productivity of computational scientists.  Software libraries such
as the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) ameliorate this
problem by providing a standard interface for which computer
scientists and hardware vendors have created highly-tuned
implementations.  Scientific applications often require a sequence
of BLAS operations, which presents further opportunities for memory
optimization.  However, because BLAS are tuned in isolation they do
not take advantage of these opportunities.  This phenomenon
motivated the recent addition to the BLAS of several routines that
perform sequences of operations.  Unfortunately, the exact sequence
of operations needed in a given situation is highly application
dependent, so many more routines are needed.
<p>
In this talk I present preliminary work on a domain-specific
compiler that generates implementations for arbitrary sequences of
basic linear algebra operations and tunes them for memory
efficiency. We report experimental results for dense kernels and
show speedups of 25% to 120% relative to sequences of calls to
GotoBLAS and vendor-tuned BLAS on Intel Xeon and IBM PowerPC
platforms.
