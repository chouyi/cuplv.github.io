    <h1>Automatically Identifying Compiler Performance Anomalies</h1>

Compilers employ many aggressive code transformations to achieve
highly optimized code.  However, because of complex target
architectures and unpredictable optimization interactions, these
transformations may not always be beneficial.  To improve the compiler
development process and the overall quality compiled code, we propose
to expedite the compiler tuning process using a technique called
relative profile data analysis (RPDA). RPDA compares profiles
collected from differently compiled versions of the same program to
identify specific functions that exhibit anomalous behavior.  We
present several case studies using the tool to identify interesting
comparisons between different compiler suites, versions, and target
architectures.  The tool has already been used to identify and help
fix performance anomalies in the Intel compiler.
