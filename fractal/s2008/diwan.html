    <h1>Algorithmic optimizations</h1>

Language semantics often prevent many reasonable optimizations.  In this
talk, I'll describe an optimization system that performs aggressive
optimizations by interacting with the user.  Specifically, our system
identifies near misses for optimizations and for these near misses, it comes
up with reasons why the optimization was inapplicable.  The user can enable
the optimization by providing assumptions that address the reasons.
