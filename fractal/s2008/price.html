    <h1>Visualizing Potential Parallelism in Sequential Programs with ParaMeter</h1>

Parallelizing sequential applications is non-trivial, but is
increasingly important with the rise of multicore systems.  We show a
case study that supports the idea that finding and extracting regions
of code for parallelism can be aided by analysis of dynamic program
trace information.  However, program traces for just a few seconds of
execution are enormous, up to several terabytes in size, uncompressed.
<p>
Specialized compression can shrink traces to a few gigabytes, but
trace analyzers typically stream the decompressed trace through
the analysis engine.  Thus, the complexity of analysis depends on the
decompressed trace size (even though the decompressed trace is never
stored to disk).  This makes many global or interactive analysis
infeasible.
<p>
This presentation discusses how to use BDDs to compress traces in a
way that yields reasonable size, rapid analysis and rapid
visualization.  BDDs intrinsically support operations common to many
desirable program analyses and these analyses operate directly on the
BDD, avoiding decompression.  Furthermore, we show that BDDs also give
the ability to rapidly visualize and explore potential parallelism in
the dynamic trace.  ParaMeter, our BDD-based trace analysis tool, can
perform visualization up to 75,000 times faster than prior approaches
while still maintaining up to 60x compression.  The talk will
demonstrate the effectiveness of ParaMeter by using it to parallelize a
region of the SPEC INT 2000 benchmark 175.vpr.
