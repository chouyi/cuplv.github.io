    <h1>Parallelizing Irregular Gauss-Seidel Using Full Sparse Tiling</h1>

Sparse computations occur in several important science and
engineering domains: molecular dynamics simulations, finite
element analysis, etc.  Due to irregular memory references
such as A[B[i]], run-time reordering transformations (RTRT)
are required to improve the data locality and parallelism of
such applications.  We present an RTRT called full sparse
tiling and show how it improves the data locality and
enables parallelism in various sparse computations.
