    <h1>Toward a Formal Evaluation of Refactorings</h1>

Refactoring is a software development strategy that characteristically
alters the syntactic structure of a program without changing its
external behavior.  Although refactorings are often applied to
facilitate the addition of new features, they may also be applied in
order improve the overall comprehensibility of a piece of software.
Even though a refactored design must at bottom commit to just as many
implementation details as its unrefactored precursor, it is a frequent
claim made about such refactorings that they provide a kind of
``self-documentation'' or transparency that is lacking in the
original.  In this talk we explore the use of formal tools to extract
information from object-oriented programs and to evaluate these claims
of improved comprehensibility in terms of any improved verifiability
the refactored programs may offer.
