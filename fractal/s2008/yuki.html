    <h1>Performance Modeling of the IBM Cell Broadband Engine Using Neural Networks</h1>

Tiling is commonly used to optimize scientific computations.
Performance modeling to narrow down the search space is a technique
used to help find the best tile sizes. It is difficult to analytically
model the performance of the IBM Cell Broadband Engine due to its
characteristics. We used neural networks to derive models that predict
the best tile sizes for matrix multiplication on the Cell. The
performance of the predicted tile sizes were higher than 90% of the
observed maximum for most of the problem sizes we tested.
