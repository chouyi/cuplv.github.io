    <h1>Monads through program extraction</h1>

Closing the gap between formalized proof and practical programming has long
been an  objective of working in type theory.  Monads epitomize this
balance.  They are a formal construct but have revolutionized programming in
purely functional environments.  We play on this relationship by formalizing
the structure of a monad as a type.  By instantiating the type constructor
and its associated operators in a dependent type theory we are able to
reason about monads as we would a type.  By
the fact that we are working in a constructive context this reasoning means
that we can begin to close that gap between a formal proof and practical
programming when it comes to monads.  We are able to extract instances of
the operators by the fact that we can prove propositions that correspond to
that type.  In this paper we will do this in
two varieties.  The first is that by knowing the algorithm the operators
correspond to we can easily state them as an object in our language. We then
prove that they have the correct type, the type of the output for which we
are trying to generate. The second methodology is to prove a  behavior
specification and there by obtain an extract based on what the program is
supposed to do.  Our extract is in the form of a term in a purely functional
programming language that is just as powerful as any more common language.
We contrast this with the first method which
is a statement of verification, or of how to do a certain computation.
In our process of verifying and specifying (extracting) monads we show
that particular instances of common monads are definable in our type
theory.  We show that the monad is a well defined type. And
we give examples showing that our monads are usable.
