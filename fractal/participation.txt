We have a great set of talks lined up for Fractal Fall 2009!

For this Fractal, we are introducing the Madness Session where we invite all
participants to give a short presentation on, for example, a wild and crazy
idea, a recent discovery, or a challenge problem.  You will have approximately
5 minutes for your madness talk.  We especially encourage all students who
are not giving a full-length presentation to consider speaking in the Madness
Session.

Presenters, please note that the talk slots are 20 minutes including questions.
Please limit your presentation to 17 minutes to allow time for discussion.

All participants, please help us plan for food by completing the registration
form on the Fractal website by next Friday, November 20, 2009.
