	  Validation and Parameter Discovery for Stochastic Computational Models from Behavioral Specifications
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>The success of high-performance computing has facilitated the rapid development of increasingly complex models of natural and engineered systems by biologists, physicists, chemists, and even financial engineers. While the development of such models requires considerable domain knowledge and arguably little knowledge of the science of computing itself, we survey a key problem in computational modeling that cuts across boundaries of scientific disciplines and motivates the development of new massively parallel high-performance algorithms: the validation and parameter discovery for stochastic computational models.</p>

	  Getting Off the Monorail or: How Twitter Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Monads
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Twitter is one of the most heavily trafficked sites on
	  the internet, with over 140 million active users and serving
	  over 400 million Tweets per day. Historically, nearly all of
	  Twitter's traffic has been served by a monolithic
	  application written in Ruby on Rails, referred to internally
	  as "the monorail." Although Twitter has seen remarkable
	  growth in its six years of existence, scaling this
	  monolithic architecture has proved to be both error-prone
	  and expensive, not only in terms of computational
	  efficiency, but in terms of developer efficiency as well.</p>
	  <p>More recently, Twitter has begun the process of replacing
	  the monorail with a Services Oriented Architecture (SOA),
	  where the services are JVM processes--mostly written in
	  Scala--that communicate with one-another asynchronously over
	  a network connection. Naively written, asynchronous code is
	  often both tedious to write and difficult to reason about;
	  at Twitter, the asynchronous code implementing Scala
	  services is both simple and beautiful, thanks in large part
	  to an internally-developed, open-source library called
	  Finagle.</p>
	  <p>In this talk, I will attempt to explain how Finagle's
	  strong grounding in programming language theory has
	  facilitated this transition to an SOA, and how Scala's
	  advanced features allow for a library as expressive as
	  Finagle to have been written in the first place.</p>

	  Finding Falsifications in Complex Cyber-Physical Systems
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) combine discretely evolving
	  computational components with a continuously changing
	  physical world. Examples of CPS include safety-critical
	  systems that control airplanes, automobiles, power plants
	  and implantable medical devices. Assuring the safety of
	  these systems requires techniques that transcend the limited
	  coverage provided by testing/simulation. Even though
	  impressive progress has been achieved with symbolic formal
	  verification techniques for linear systems, the verification
	  of non-linear, industrial scale CPS designs remains a
	  distant goal.</p> <p>In this talk, I present a simple yet
	  effective approach to automatically searching for property
	  violations in non-linear systems.  Our approach defines the
	  notion of robustness metrics over traces that can be used to
	  measure distances between simulation traces and properties
	  expressed in temporal logics.  As a result, robustness
	  metrics can naturally quantify how "close" a particular
	  simulation of the system is to violating a property of
	  interest.  By treating robustness metrics as an objective
	  function to minimize over the simulation traces of the
	  system, we can use many off-the-shelf global optimization
	  techniques to effectively steer the simulations towards a
	  falsification of the property being considered.</p>
	  <p>Despite the lack of strong formal guarantees, we find
	  that robustness-guided falsification is a promising approach
	  to searching for property violations in complex systems.  We
	  present the S-Taliro tool, an implementation of our approach
	  to reason about properties of non-linear systems modeled as
	  Simulink/Stateflow diagrams.  We present two interesting
	  case studies using S-Taliro, including a risk analysis of
	  insulin infusion pump usage by diabetic patients that models
	  the software in the pump in conjunction with the dynamics of
	  insulin/glucose regulatory system.</p>

	  Program Analysis for C++
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Program analyzes have been successful in finding serious
	  program defects such as NULL pointer accesses or buffer
	  overflows in programs written in C. However, industry relies
	  heavily on object-oriented languages, such as Java and C++.
	  This talk presents our recent advances in static analysis
	  for C++. It focuses on C++ specific difficulties such as
	  multiple inheritance, conversion from C++ strings to C
	  strings and vice versa, and C++ exception semantics.</p>

	  Probabilistic Approximation and Analysis Bio-pathways Dynamics
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>A system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) is
	  often used to model the dynamics of a bio-chemical
	  network. Such systems are difficult to analyze. To get
	  around this, we construct a discrete probabilistic
	  approximation of the ODE dynamics as a dynamic Bayesian
	  network.  Consequently, pathway properties can be analyzed
	  using standard Bayesian inference techniques. Apart from
	  testing our method on ODEs models drawn from the biomodels
	  data base, we have used our technique in a combined
	  computational and experimental study of the human complement
	  system under inflammation conditions.  Our results are very
	  encouraging in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we
	  have extended the scalability of our approach via a GPU
	  implementation.</p>

	  Towards the Verification of Hybrid Data-Flow Languages
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Hybrid systems are used to model embedded computing
	  systems interacting with their physical environment. There
	  is a conceptual mismatch between high-level hybrid system
	  languages, like Simulink, which are used for simulation, and
	  hybrid automata, the most suitable representation for safety
	  verification. Indeed, in simulation languages the
	  interaction between discrete and continuous execution steps
	  is specified using the concept of zero-crossings, whereas
	  hybrid automata exploit the notion of staying conditions.
	  In this talk we first briefly present Zelus, a synchronous
	  data-flow language extended with ordinary differential
	  equations.  Then we propose a sound translation from a
	  Zelus-like hybrid data-flow formalism to logico-numerical
	  hybrid automata discussing various zero-crossing semantics
	  and the extent to which the original semantics is preserved.
	  At last we sketch how existing continuous reachability
	  analysis methods can be applied to logico-numerical hybrid
	  automata.</p>

	<abstract>
	  <p>We describe BDDAPRON, a freely available library
	  dedicated to the static analysis of finite-type and

	  <p>BDDAPRON provides ready-to-use logico-numerical
	  abstractions for combinations of finite-type and numerical
	  variables, as well as powerful symbolic manipulations of
	  expressions.</p> 
	  <p>Algorithmically, BDDAPRON combines BDD techniques (using
	  the CUDD library) with numerical abstract domains provided
	  by the APRON library. We describe the principles behind this
	  combination and the various available options for the
	  computation of abstract transfer functions.</p>
	  <p>At last, we present some applications of the BDDAPRON
	  abstract domain to program verification, including recursive
	  program with pointers.</p>

	  What can the Garbage Collector compute efficiently? A
	  Language for Heap Assertions at Garbage Collection Time
	</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Finding bugs is among the most challenging tasks in
	  software development.  For this reason, modern software
	  development methodologies encourage programmers to use
	  assertions throughout their code to express the assumptions
	  they are making.  At runtime, these assertions then detect
	  whenever the assumptions do not match the program; in other
	  words, they detect bugs early.  However, traditional
	  assertion mechanisms in mainstream languages such as C or
	  Java are limited in their expressivity.</p>
	  <p>This talk presents DeAL, a rich heap assertion language
	  for Java that extends over the expressive power of
	  traditional assertions.  DeAL introduces additional
	  primitives to reason over heap layout, allowing programmers
	  to assert global invariants, ownership, and other properties
	  that would be impossible to express in traditional
	  assertions.</p>
	  <p>By design, all DeAL assertions require only a single heap
	  traversal and can execute as part of garbage collection.
	  Consequently, DeAL is not only expressive, but also ensures
	  a very low execution overhead.</p>

	<title>Building Verified Software with Dependent Types</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Recent years have seen intensive interest among
	  Programming Language (PL) researchers in connecting PL and
	  Verification.  Static analyses which once were primarily
	  intended for enabling optimizations in compilers are now
	  used also for program verification and bug finding.  Type
	  systems, which had been used to detect (either statically or
	  dynamically) low-level bugs, are now pushed to express
	  stronger and stronger semantic properties of code.  Arguably
	  the most powerful such systems known are so-called dependent
	  type systems, which combine programming and theorem proving,
	  and use rich types to express general logical specifications
	  of programs.</p>
	  <p>In this talk, I will describe ongoing work in my group to
	  design, prove, and implement dependently typed programming
	  languages, and apply them for challenging case studies.  I
	  will summarize the design of the Guru dependently typed
	  programming language, and explain how it overcomes some
	  traditional difficulties for dependently typed languages,
	  concerning general recursion and also the treatment of
	  equality.  For a case study, I will describe recent work of
	  my doctoral student Duckki Oe to implement a statically
	  verified modern SAT solver called versat in Guru. Versat
	  uses the efficient low-level data structures and algorithms
	  of modern solvers like Minisat, but has been statically
	  verified to be sound: if versat reports "unsat", then the
	  input formula is truly contradictory.  Versat can solve
	  benchmarks on the modern scale, including some from the SAT
	  Competition 2009.  I will conclude with a glimpse at a new
	  dependently typed language called Trellys, being designed
	  and implemented in a collaborative project with Stephanie
	  Weirich at U. Pennsylvania and Tim Sheard at Portland
	  State.</p>

	<title>Proving stabilisation of biological models</title>
	<abstract>
	  I will describe an efficient procedure for proving
	  stabilisation of biological systems when modeled as
	  qualitative networks or genetic regulatory networks. For
	  scalability, we use modular proof techniques, where
	  state-space exploration is applied only locally to small
	  pieces of the system rather than the entire system as a
	  whole. Our procedure exploits the observation that, in
	  practice, the form of modular proofs can be restricted to a
	  very limited set.  Using our new procedure, we have solved a
	  number of challenging published examples, including: a 3-D
	  model of the mammalian epidermis; a model of metabolic
	  networks operating in type-2 diabetes; a model of fate
	  determination of vulval precursor cells in the C. elegans
	  worm; and a model of pair-rule regulation during
	  segmentation in the Drosophila embryo. Our results show many
	  orders of magnitude speedup in cases where previous
	  stabilization proving techniques were known to succeed, and
	  new results in cases where tools had previously failed.

	<title>Symbolic Predictive Analysis for Concurrent Programs</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Multi-core and multi-processor systems are becoming
	  increasingly popular. However, our ability to effectively
	  harness the power of parallelism is predicated upon advances
	  in tools and algorithms for verifying concurrent
	  programs. Concurrent programs are notoriously difficult to
	  verify, and a key reason for this is the behavioral
	  complexity resulting from the large number of interleavings
	  of concurrent threads.</p>
	  <p>In this talk, I will introduce a symbolic predictive
	  analysis for runtime detection of concurrency errors, by
	  monitoring and subsequently analyzing the execution traces
	  of a program. In this analysis, we first derive a symbolic
	  predictive model using the trace information collected at
	  run time as well as the program source code. What this model
	  captures are not just the given traces, but all possible
	  interleavings of events of these traces. Then we use
	  symbolic reasoning to check whether there are concurrency
	  errors in any of these interleavings. This is done by
	  capturing these interleavings and the error conditions using
	  a set of first-order logic formulas, and then deciding the
	  formulas using an off-the-shelf Satisfiability Modulo Theory
	  (SMT) solver.</p>

	<title>The Astrée Analyzer: Proving the absence of runtime
	errors automatically</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Runtime errors in embedded softwares may have disastrous
	  consequences, e.g. in transportation or energy production
	  systems.</p>
	  <p>The Astrée analyzer aims at proving the absence of
	  runtime errors in C programs and was designed specifically
	  for synchronous applications as found in fly-by-wire
	  systems. The analysis process is conservative, that is, it
	  may fail to establish the correctness of some safe programs,
	  but it is sound, that is it will report any runtime error.</p>
	  <p>Astrée performs Abstract Interpretation based static
	  analysis, that is abstract execution, using families of
	  predicates formed by abstract domains. Astrée relies on a
	  library of numerical and symbolic abstract domains, which
	  allow to capture salient properties of embedded softwares,
	  so as to establish absence of runtime errors. The analysis
	  process is fully automatic, and involves automatic
	  parameterization of the abstract domains.</p>
	  <p>We will present the underlying concepts of Astrée, and
	  examplify the use of the analyzer on a few selected
	  examples.</p>
	  <p>The Astrée analyzer has allowed to prove the absence of
	  runtime errors in industrial size avionics programs. As of
	  today, Absint Angewandte Informatik provides commercial
	  diffusion and support of Astrée.</p>

	<title>New methods for proving temporal properties of infinite-state systems</title>
	<abstract>
	  I will describe some new methods of proving temporal
	  properties of infinite-state programs.  Our approach takes
	  advantage of the fact that linear-temporal properties can
	  often be proved more efficiently using proof techniques
	  usually associated with the branching-time logic CTL.  The
	  caveat is that, in certain instances, nondeterminism in the
	  system's transition relation can cause CTL methods to report
	  counterexamples that are spurious in LTL. To address this
	  problem we describe an algorithm that, as it attempts to
	  apply CTL proof methods, finds and then removes problematic
	  nondeterminism via an analysis on the spurious
	  counterexamples. We must also develop CTL symbolic model
	  checking tools for infinite-state systems.

	<title>How to Build Your Own Bidirectional Programming Language</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Most programs get used in just one direction, from input
	  to output. But sometimes, having computed an output, we need
	  to be able to update this output and then "calculate
	  backwards" to find a correspondingly updated input. The
	  problem of writing such bidirectional transformations --
	  often called lenses -- arises in applications across a
	  multitude of domains and has been attacked from many
	  perspectives. Potential applications include synchronization
	  of replicated data, system configuration management tools
	  (such as RedHat's Augeas system), bidirectional
	  transformations between software models, and updatable
	  "security views."</p>
	  <p>The Harmony project at the University of Pennsylvania is
	  exploring a linguistic approach to bidirectional
	  programming, designing domain-specific languages in which
	  every expression simultaneously describes both parts of a
	  lens. When read from left to right, an expression denotes an
	  ordinary function that maps inputs to outputs. When read
	  from right to left, it denotes an "update translator" that
	  takes an input together with an updated output and produces
	  a new input that reflects the update. These languages share
	  some common elements with modern functional languages -- in
	  particular, they come with very expressive type systems. In
	  other respects, they are rather novel and surprising.</p>
	  <p>We have designed, implemented, and applied bi-directional
	  languages in three quite different domains: a language for
	  bidirectional transformations on trees (such as XML
	  documents), based on a collection of primitive bidirectional
	  tree transformation operations and
	  "bidirectionality-preserving" combining forms; a language
	  for bidirectional views of relational data, using
	  bidirectionalized versions of the operators of relational
	  algebra as primitives; and, most recently, a language for
	  bidirectional string transformations, with primitives based
	  on standard notations for finite-state transduction and a
	  type system based on regular expressions. The string case is
	  especially interesting, both in its own right and because it
	  exposes a number of foundational issues common to all
	  bidirectional programming languages in a simple and familiar
	  setting. We are also exploring how lenses and their types
	  can be enriched to embody privacy and integrity policies.</p>
	  <p>This talk explores the design of bidirectional languages,
	  starting from the very simplest imaginable variant
	  (bijective languages) and then developing several
	  refinements.</p>

	<title>Towards a Science of Parallel Programming</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>When parallel programming started in the 70s and 80s, it
	  was mostly art: languages such as functional and logic
	  programming languages were designed and appreciated mainly
	  for their elegance and beauty. More recently, parallel
	  programming has become engineering: conventional languages
	  like FORTRAN and C++ have been extended with constructs such
	  as OpenMP, and we now spend our time benchmarking and
	  tweaking large programs nobody understands to obtain
	  performance improvements of 5-10%. In spite of all this
	  activity, we have few insights into how to write parallel
	  programs to exploit the performance potential of multicore
	  processors.</p>
	  <p>To break this impasse, we need a science of parallel
	  programming. In this talk, I will introduce a concept called
	  "amorphous data-parallelism" that provides a simple, unified
	  picture of parallelism in a host of diverse applications
	  ranging from mesh generation/refinement/partitioning to SAT
	  solvers, maxflow algorithms, stencil computations, and
	  event-driven simulation. Then I will present a natural
	  classification that provides insight into the structure of
	  parallelism and locality in these algorithms and into
	  appropriate language and systems support for exploiting this
	  parallelism.</p>

	  Desktop software, in the form of web browsers, browser
	  features, and OS distributions, are a growing area of
	  engineering activity at Google. This talk will give an
	  overview of this work, looking in detail at Native Client as

	  open-source research technology for running x86 native code
	  in web applications, with the goal of maintaining the
	  browser neutrality, OS portability, and safety that people
	  expect from web apps. It supports performance-oriented
	  features generally absent from web application programming
	  environments, such as thread support, instruction set
	  extensions such as SSE, and use of compiler intrinsics and
	  hand-coded assembler. We combine these properties in an open
	  architecture designed to leverage existing web standards,
	  and to encourage community review and third-party
	  tools. Overall, Google's desktop efforts seek to enable new
	  Web applications, improve end-user experience, and enable a
	  more flexible balance between client and server
	  computing. Google has open sourced many of our desktop
	  efforts, in part to encourage collaboration and independent
	  innovation.

	<title>Introducing the Sparse Polyhedral Framework</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Loops often dominate the execution time of
	  applications. Various transformation frameworks have been
	  developed to enable the automatic compile-time
	  transformation of loops. Many of the existing models fit
	  within the polyhedral framework and although they are quite
	  powerful, they are restricted to compile-time
	  transformations and loop bounds and memory accesses that are
	  affine or can be approximated as affine.</p>
	  <p>In this talk, I will present the Sparse Polyhedral
	  Framework (SPF). The SPF builds on the polyhedral
	  programming model, but is also capable of expressing and
	  supporting the code generation for run-time reordering
	  transformations implemented with inspector/executor
	  strategies. I will then discuss the idea of abstractions for
	  exposing transformation frameworks in performance programmer
	  models.</p>

	<title>Algorithmic Program Synthesis with Partial Programs</title>
	<abstract>
	  <p>Why hasn't Moore's Law revolutionize programming?  In
	  model checking, cycles fuel bug discovery, improving code
	  quality, but programmers still write programs with their
	  bare hands.  In fact, their work has not changed much since
	  the CRT terminal, except that they think in better
	  languages.</p>
	  <p>Program synthesis might be a way to reduce
	  the programmer's cognitive load.  Synthesizers have derived
	  programs that were highly efficient, and sometimes even
	  surprising.  Of course, they had to be first "programmed"
	  with the human insights about the domain at hand.</p>
	  <p>Which brings us to a key problem in program synthesis ---
	  how to communicate human expertise to the synthesizer.  In
	  deductive synthesis, this expertise is captured in a domain
	  theory.  Often elusive even to formally trained experts, a
	  domain theory is probably not a shortcut to programmer
	  productivity.</p> <p>This talk will describe a growing
	  family of synthesizers based on partial programs.  Their
	  premise is that programs can be decomposed into insight and
	  mechanics: if the programmer encodes her insight as a
	  partial program, the mechanics can then be synthesized given
	  a specification.  Partial programs lend themselves to
	  algorithmic synthesis: rather than deducing a program with a
	  theorem prover, algorithmic synthesis finds the program in a
	  space of candidate implementations described by the partial
	  program.</p>
	  <p>Among five synthesizers, I will describe an algorithm for
	  finding a candidate by constraint solving, rather than via
	  generate-and-test, and a system for programming with angelic
	  non-determinism which computes the insight into a
	  programming problem.</p>

	<p>We present techniques for the analysis of infinite state
	probabilistic programs to synthesize probabilistic invariants and prove
	almost-sure termination. Our analysis is based on the notion of (super)
	martingales from probability theory. First, we define the concept of
	(super) martingales for loops in probabilistic programs. Next, we
	present the use of concentration of measure inequalities to bound the
	values of martingales with high probability. This directly allows us to
	infer probabilistic bounds on assertions involving the program
	variables. Next, we present the notion of a super martingale ranking
	function (SMRF) to prove almost sure termination of probabilistic
	programs. Finally, we extend constraint-based techniques to synthesize
	martingales and super-martingale ranking functions for probabilistic
	programs. We present some applications of our approach to reason about
	invariance and termination of small but complex probabilistic programs.</p>

	  <p>We present a precise, path-sensitive static analysis for reasoning about
	  <em>heap reachability</em>; that is, whether an object can be reached
	  from another variable or object via pointer dereferences. Precise
	  reachability information is useful for a number of clients, including
	  static detection of a class of Android memory leaks. For this client,
	  we found that the heap reachability information computed by a
	  state-of-the-art points-to analysis was too imprecise, leading to
	  numerous false-positive leak reports. Our analysis combines a symbolic
	  execution capable of path-sensitivity and strong updates with abstract
	  heap information computed by an initial flow-insensitive points-to
	  analysis. This novel <em>mixed</em> representation allows us to
	  achieve both precision and scalability by leveraging the pre-computed
	  points-to facts to guide execution and prune infeasible paths. We have
	  evaluated our techniques in the <span style="font-variant:
	  small-caps">Thresher</span> tool, which we used to find several

	<p>We propose an approach for the static analysis of probabilistic
	programs that sense, manipulate, and control based on uncertain
	data. Examples include programs used in risk analysis, medical
	decision making and cyber-physical systems. Correctness properties
	of such programs take the form of <em>queries</em> that seek the
	probabilities of assertions over program variables.  We present a
	static analysis approach that provides guaranteed interval bounds on
	the values (assertion probabilities) of such queries.  First, we
	observe that for probabilistic programs, it is possible to conclude
	facts about the behavior of the entire program by choosing a finite,
	<em>adequate set</em> of its paths. We provide strategies for choosing
	such a set of paths and verifying its adequacy.  The queries are
	evaluated over each path by a combination of symbolic execution and
	probabilistic volume-bound computations. Each path yields interval
	bounds that can be summed up with a "coverage"  bound to yield an
	interval that encloses the probability of assertion for the program
	as a whole.  We demonstrate promising results on a suite of
	benchmarks from many different sources including robotic
	manipulators and medical decision making programs.</p>

	<p>Fixed point digital filters are simple yet ubiquitous components of a
	wide variety of digital processing and control systems. Common errors
        in fixed point filters include arithmetic round-off (truncation) errors,
	overflows and the presence of limit cycles. These errors can potentially
	compromise the correctness of the system as a whole. Traditionally digital
	filters have been verified using a combination of design techniques from control
	theory and extensive testing. In this paper, we examine the use of formal
	verification techniques as part of the design flow for fixed point digital
	filters. We study two classes of verification techniques involving bit-precise
	analysis and real-valued error approximations, respectively. We empirically
	evaluate several variants of these two fundamental approaches for verifying
	fixed-point implementations of digital filters. We design our comparison to
	reveal the best possible approach towards verifying real-world designs of
	infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters. Our study compares the
	strengths and weaknesses of different verification techniques for digital
	filters and suggests efficient approaches using modern
	satisfiability-modulo-theories solvers (SMT) and hardware model checkers. This
	manuscript extends our previous work evaluating bounded verification, where a
	limited number of iterations of the system are explored, with unbounded
	verification, where an unlimited number of iterations of the system are
	considered. Doing so allows us to evaluate techniques that can prove the
	correctness of fixed point digital filter implementations.</p>

      <abstract>
	<p>Real-world data structures are often enhanced with additional
	pointers capturing alternative paths through a basic inductive skeleton
        (e.g., back pointers, head pointers). From the static analysis point of view,
	we must obtain several interlocking shape invariants. At the same time, it is
	well understood in abstract interpretation design that supporting a separation
	of concerns is critically important to designing powerful static analyses.
	Such a separation of concerns is often obtained via a reduced product on a
	case-by-case basis. In this paper, we lift this idea to abstract domains for
	shape analyses, introducing a domain combination operator for memory
	abstractions. As an example, we present <em>simultaneous separating shape
	graphs</em>, a product construction that combines instances of
	separation logic-based shape domains. The key enabler for this
	construction is a static analysis on inductive data structure
	definitions to derive relations between the skeleton and the alternative
	paths. From the engineering standpoint, this construction allows each
	component to reason independently about different aspects of the data
	structure invariant and then separately exchange information via a
	reduction operator. From the usability standpoint, we enable describing
	a data structure invariant in terms of several inductive definitions
	that hold simultaneously.</p>

        <p>We examine the problem of inferring invariants for
        parametrized systems. Parametrized systems are concurrent
        systems consisting of an a priori unbounded number of process
        instances running the same program. Such systems are commonly
        encountered in many situations including device drivers,
        distributed systems, and robotic swarms. In this paper we
        describe a technique that enables leveraging off-the-shelf
        invariant generators designed for sequential programs to infer
        invariants of parametrized systems. The central challenge in
        invariant inference for parametrized systems is that näıvely
        exploding the transition system with all interleavings is not
        just impractical but impossible. In our approach, the key
        enabler is the notion of a reﬂective abstraction that we prove
        has an important correspondence with inductive
        invariants. This correspondence naturally gives rise to an
        iterative invariant generation procedure that alternates
        between computing candidate invariants and creating reﬂective
        abstractions.</p>

	<p>A static analysis design is <em>sufficient</em> if it can
	prove the property of interest with an acceptable number of
	false alarms.  Ultimately, the only way to confirm that an
	analysis design is sufficient is to implement it and run it on
	real-world programs.  If the evaluation shows that the design
	is insufficient, the designer must return to the drawing board
	and repeat the process&emdash;wasting expensive implementation
	effort over and over again.  In this paper, we make the
	observation that there is a minimal range of code needed to
	prove a property of interest under an ideal static analysis;
	we call such a range of code a <em>validation scope</em>.
	Armed with this observation, we create a dynamic measurement
	framework that quantifies validation scopes and thus enables
	designers to rule out insufficient designs at lower cost.  A
	novel attribute of our framework is the ability to model
	aspects of static reasoning using dynamic execution
	measurements.  To evaluate the flexibility of our framework,
	we instantiate it on an example property&emdash;null
	dereference errors&emdash;and measure validation scopes on
	real-world programs. We use a broad range of metrics that
	capture the difficulty of analyzing programs along varying
	dimensions.  We also examine how validation scopes evolve as
	developers fix null dereference errors and as code matures.
	We find that bug fixes shorten validation scopes, that longer
	validation scopes are more likely to be buggy, and that
	overall validation scopes are remarkably stable as programs
	evolve.</p>

        <p>Abstraction refinement is an effective verification
        technique for automatically proving safety properties of
        software. Application of this technique in shape analyses has proved
        impractical as core components of existing refinement techniques such
        as backward analysis, general conjunction, and identification of
        unreachable but doomed states are computationally infeasible in such
        domains.</p>
        <p>We propose a new method to diagnose proof failures to
        be used in a refinement scheme for Separation Logic–based shape
        analyses. To check feasibility of abstract error traces, we perform
        Bounded Model Checking over the traces using a novel encoding into
        SMT. A subsequent diagnosis finds discontinuities on infeasible
        traces, and identifies doomed states admitted by the abstraction. To
        construct doomed states, we give a model-finding algorithm for
        “symbolic heap” Separation Logic formulas, employing the execution
        machinery of the feasibility checker to search for concrete
        counter-examples. The diagnosis has been implemented in SLAyer, and we

        <p>
          In this paper, we define timed relational abstractions for
          verifying sampled data control systems. Sampled data control
          systems consist of a plant, modeled as a hybrid system and a
          synchronous controller, modeled as a discrete transition
          system. The controller computes control inputs and/or sends
          control events to the plant based on the periodically
          sampled state of the plant. The correctness of the system
          depends on the controller design as well as an appropriate
          choice of the controller sampling period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our approach constructs a timed relational abstraction of
          the hybrid plant by replacing the continuous plant dynamics
          by relations. These relations map a state of the plant to
          states reachable within the sampling time period. We present
          techniques for building timed relational abstractions, while
          taking care of discrete transitions that can be taken by the
          plant between samples. The resulting abstractions are better
          suited for the verification of sampled data control
          systems. The abstractions focus on the states that can be
          observed by the controller at the sample times, while
          abstracting away behaviors between sample times
          conservatively. The resulting abstractions are discrete,
          infinite-state transition systems. Thus conventional
          verification tools can be used to verify safety properties
          of these abstractions. We use k-induction to prove safety
          properties and bounded model checking (BMC) to find
          potential falsifications. We present our idea, its
          implementation and results on many benchmark examples.

        <p>A SAT-based incremental, inductive algorithm for model
        checking CTL properties is proposed. As in classic CTL model
        checking, the parse graph of the property shapes the
        analysis. However, in the proposed algorithm, called IICTL,
        the analysis is directed by task states that are pushed down
        the parse tree. To each node is associated over- and
        under-approximations to the set of states satisfying that
        node’s property; these approximations are refined until a
        proof that the property does or does not hold is
        obtained. Each CTL operator corresponds naturally to an
        incremental sub-query: given a task state, an EX node executes
        a SAT query; an EU node applies IC3; and an EG node applies
        FAIR. In each case, the query result provides more general
        information than necessary to satisfy the task. When a query
        is satisfiable, the returned trace is generalized using
        forall-exists reasoning, during which IC3 is applied to obtain
        new reachability information that enables greater
        generalization. When a query is unsatisfiable, the proof
        provides the generalization. In this way, property-directed
        abstraction is achieved.

	<p>Digital filters are simple yet ubiquitous components of a wide

	the filters can be catastrophic.  Traditionally digital
	filters have been verified using methods from control theory
	and extensive testing.  We study two alternative verification

	approximations.  In this paper, we empirically evaluate
	several variants of these two fundamental approaches for
	verifying fixed-point implementations of digital filters. We
	design our comparison to reveal the best possible approach
	towards verifying real-world designs of infinite impulse
	response (IIR) digital filters. Our study reveals broader
	insights into cases where bit-reasoning is absolutely
	necessary and suggests efficient approaches using modern

	<p>An incremental algorithm for model checking progress
	properties is proposed. It follows from the following insight:
	any SCC-closed region of a system’s state graph can be
	represented by a sequence of inductive assertions. Each
	iteration of the algorithm selects a set of states, called a
	skeleton, that together satisfy all fairness conditions; it
	then applies safety model checkers to attempt to connect the
	states into a reachable fair cycle. If this attempt fails, the
	resulting learned lemma takes one of two forms: an inductive
	reachability assertion that shows that at least one state of
	the skeleton is unreachable, or an inductive wall that deﬁnes
	two SCC-closed regions of the state graph. Subsequent
	skeletons must be chosen entirely from one side of the
	wall. Because a lemma often applies more generally than to the
	one skeleton from which it was derived, property-directed
	abstraction is achieved. The algorithm is highly
	parallelizable.</p>

	<p>We present techniques for determining the precision gap
	between Andersen's points-to analysis and precise
	flow-insensitive points-to analysis in practice.  While
	previous work has shown that such a gap may exist, no
	efficient algorithm for precise flow-insensitive analysis is
	known, making measurement of the gap on real-world programs
	difficult.  We give an algorithm for precise flow-insensitive
	analysis of programs with finite memory, based on a novel
	technique for refining any points-to analysis with a search
	for flow-insensitive witnesses.  We give a compact symbolic
	encoding of the technique that enables computing the search
	using a tuned SAT solver.  We also present extensions of the
	algorithm that enable computing lower and upper bounds on the
	precision gap in the presence of dynamic memory allocation. In
	our experimental evaluation over a suite of small- to
	medium-sized C programs, we never observed a precision gap
	between Andersen's analysis and the precise analysis. In other
	words, Andersen's analysis computed a precise flow-insensitive
	result for all of our benchmarks.  Hence, we conclude that
	while better algorithms for the precise flow-insensitive
	analysis are still of theoretical interest, their practical
	impact for C programs is likely to be negligible.</p>

  <p> In this paper, we define relational abstractions of hybrid systems.
  A relational abstraction is obtained by replacing the continuous
  dynamics in each mode by a binary transition relation that relates a
  state of the system to any state that can potentially be reached at
  some future time instant using the continuous dynamics.  We
  construct relational abstractions by reusing template-based
  invariant generation techniques for continuous systems described by
  Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE).  As a result, we abstract a
  given hybrid system as a purely discrete, infinite-state system.  We
  apply k-induction to this abstraction to prove safety properties,
  and use bounded model-checking to find potential falsifications.  We
  present the basic underpinnings of our approach and demonstrate its
  use on many benchmark systems to derive simple and usable
  abstractions. </p>

 <p>      We present abstraction techniques that transform a given non-linear
  dynamical system into a linear system, such that, invariant
  properties of the resulting linear abstraction can be used to infer
  invariants for the original system. The abstraction techniques rely
  on a change of bases transformation that associates each state
  variable of the abstract system with a function involving the state
  variables of the original system. We present conditions under which
  a given change of basis transformation for a non-linear system can
  define an abstraction. </p>
  
<p>  Furthermore, we present a technique to discover, given a non-linear
  system, if a change of bases transformation involving degree-bounded
  polynomials yielding a linear system abstraction exists. If so, our
  technique yields the resulting abstract linear system, as well. This
  approach is further extended to search for a change of bases
  transformation that abstracts a given non-linear system into a
  system of linear differential inclusions.  Our techniques enable the
  use of analysis techniques for linear systems to infer invariants
  for non-linear systems. We present preliminary evidence of the
  practical feasibility of our ideas using a prototype implementation. </p>

  <p>Template polyhedra generalize weakly relational domains by
  specifying arbitrary fixed linear expressions on the left-hand sides
  of inequalities and undetermined constants on the right. The domain
  operations required for analysis over template polyhedra can be
  computed in polynomial time using linear programming.  In this
  paper, we introduce the generalized template polyhedral domain that
  extends template polyhedra using fixed left-hand side expressions
  with bilinear forms involving program variables and unknown
  parameters to the right. We prove that the domain operations over
  generalized templates can be defined as the ``best possible
  abstractions'' of the corresponding polyhedral domain
  operations. The resulting analysis can straddle the entire space of
  linear relation analysis starting from the template domain to the
  full polyhedral domain.</p>


<p>  We show that analysis in the generalized template domain can be
  performed by dualizing the join, post-condition and widening
  operations.  We also investigate the special case of template
  polyhedra wherein each bilinear form has at most two parameters. For
  this domain, we use the special properties of two dimensional
  polyhedra and techniques from fractional linear programming to
  derive domain operations that can be implemented in polynomial time
  over the number of variables in the program and the size of the
  polyhedra. We present applications of generalized template polyhedra
  to strengthen previously obtained invariants by converting them into
  templates.  We describe an experimental evaluation of an
  implementation over several benchmark systems.</p>

	<p>Several programming languages are beginning to integrate

	(Gronski, Knowles, Tomb, Freund, and Flanagan, 2006) and Thorn
	(Wrigstad, Eugster, Field, Nystrom, and Vitek, 2009). However,
	an important open question remains, which is how to add
	parametric polymorphism to languages that combine static and
	dynamic typing. We present a system that permits a value of
	dynamic type to be cast to a polymorphic type and vice versa,
	with relational parametricity enforced by a kind of dynamic
	sealing along the lines proposed by Matthews and Ahmed (2008)
	and Neis, Dreyer, and Rossberg (2009). Our system includes a
	notion of blame, which allows us to show that when casting
	between a more-precise type and a less-precise type, any cast
	failures are due to the less-precisely-typed portion of the
	program. We also show that a cast from a subtype to its

	<p>Interprocedural program analysis is often performed by
	computing procedure summaries.  While possible, computing
	adequate summaries is difficult, particularly in the presence
	of recursive procedures.  In this paper, we propose a
	complementary framework for interprocedural analysis based on
	a direct abstraction of the calling context.  Specifically,
	our approach exploits the inductive structure of a calling
	context by treating it directly as a stack of activation
	records.  We then build an abstraction based on separation
	logic with inductive definitions.  A key element of this
	abstract domain is the use of parameters to refine the meaning
	of such call stack summaries and thus express relations across
	activation records and with the heap.  In essence, we define
	an abstract interpretation-based analysis framework for
	recursive programs that permits a fluid per call site
	abstraction of the call stack&emdash;much like how shape analyzers
	enable a fluid per program point abstraction of the heap.</p>

	<p>Static analysis designers must carefully balance precision
	and efficiency.  In our experience, many static analysis tools
	are built around an elegant, core algorithm, but that
	algorithm is then extensively tweaked to add just enough
	precision for the coding idioms seen in practice, without
	sacrificing too much efficiency.  There are several downsides
	to adding precision in this way: the tool's implementation
	becomes much more complicated; it can be hard for an end-user
	to interpret the tool's results; and as software systems vary
	tremendously in their coding styles, it may require
	significant algorithmic engineering to enhance a tool to
	perform well in a particular software domain.</p>
	<p>In this paper, we present Mix, a novel system that mixes
	type checking and symbolic execution.  The key aspect of our
	approach is that these analyses are applied independently on
	disjoint parts of the program, in an off-the-shelf manner.  At
	the boundaries between nested type checked and symbolically
	executed code regions, we use special mix rules to communicate
	information between the off-the-shelf systems.  The resulting
	mixture is a provably sound analysis that is more precise than
	type checking alone and more efficient than exclusive symbolic
	execution.  In addition, we also describe a prototype
	implementation, <fmt kind="tool">Mixy</fmt>, for C.  Mixy
	checks for potential null dereferences by mixing a
	null/non-null type qualifier inference system with a symbolic
	executor.</p>

	  incorrect. Thus, there is a good chance that a profiler will
	  mislead a performance analyst into wasting time optimizing a
	  cold method with little or no performance improvement.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This paper uses causality analysis to evaluate profilers and
	  to gain insight into the source of their incorrectness. It
	  shows that these profilers all violate a fundamental
	  requirement for sampling-based profilers: to be correct, a
	  sampling-based profiler must collect samples randomly.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We show that a proof-of-concept profiler, which collects
	  samples randomly, does not suffer from the above
	  problems. Specifically, we show, using a number of case
	  studies, that our profiler correctly identifies methods that
	  are important to optimize; in some cases other profilers
	  report that these methods are cold and thus not worth
	  optimizing.

	<p>The blame calculus of Wadler and Findler gives a high-level
	semantics to casts in higher-order languages. The coercion
	calculus of Henglein, on the other hand, provides an
	instruction set for casts whose normal forms ensure space
	efficiency. In this paper we address two questions: 1) can
	space efficiency be obtained in a high-level semantics? and 2)
	can we precisely characterize the relationship between the
	high and low-level semantics of casts? Towards answering both
	of these questions, we design a cast calculus that summarizes
	a sequence of casts as a threesome cast that contains a source
	type, a target type, and a third middle type that is the
	greatest lower bound of all the types in the sequence. We show
	that the threesome calculus is equivalent to the blame
	calculus and to one of the coercion-based, blame-tracking
	calculi of Siek, Garcia, and Taha. We also show that the
	threesome calculus is space efficient and obtain a tighter
	bound than that of Herman, Tomb, and Flanagan.</p>

      <abstract>
	<p>To improve the performance of transactional memory (TM),
	researchers have found many eager and lazy optimizations for
	conflict detection, the process of determining if transactions
	can commit. Despite these optimizations, nearly all TMs
	perform one aspect of lazy conflict detection in the same
	manner to preserve serializability. That is, they perform
	commit-time validation, where a transaction is checked for
	conflicts with previously committed transactions during its
	commit phase. While commit-time validation is efficient for
	workloads that exhibit limited contention, it can limit
	transaction throughput for contending workloads.

        This paper presents an efficient implementation of commit-time
        invalidation, a strategy where transactions resolve their
        conflicts with in-flight (uncommitted) transactions before
        they commit. Commit-time invalidation supplies the contention
        manager (CM) with data that is unavailable through commit-time
        validation, allowing the CM to make decisions that increase
        transaction throughput. Commit-time invalidation also requires
        notably fewer operations than commit-time validation for
        memory-intensive transactions, uses zero commit-time
        operations for dynamically detected read-only transactions,
        and guarantees full opacity for any transaction in O(N) time,
        an improvement over incremental validation's O(N2) time. Our
        experimental results show that for contending workloads, our
        efficient commit-time invalidating software TM (STM) is up to
        3 x faster than TL2, a state-of-the-art validating STM.</p>

	<p>Detailed memory models that expose individual fields are
	necessary to precisely analyze code that makes use of
	low-level aspects such as, pointers to fields and untagged
	unions.  Yet, higher-level representations that collect fields
	into records are often used because they are typically more
	convenient and efficient in modeling the program heap.  In
	this paper, we present a shape graph representation of memory
	that exposes individual fields while largely retaining the
	convenience of an object-level model.  This representation has
	a close connection to particular kinds of formulas in
	separation logic.  Then, with this representation, we show how
	to extend the <fmt kind="tool">Xisa</fmt> shape analyzer for
	low-level aspects, including pointers to fields, C-style
	nested structures and unions, malloc and free, and array
	values, with minimal changes to the core algorithms (e.g.,
	materialization and summarization).</p>

	<p>Memory bandwidth limits the performance of important
	kernels in many scientific applications. Such applications
	often use sequences of Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms
	(BLAS), and highly efficient implementations of those routines
	enable scientists to achieve high performance at little
	cost. However, tuning the BLAS in isolation misses
	opportunities for memory optimization that result from
	composing multiple subprograms. Because it is not practical to
	create a library of all BLAS combinations, we have developed a
	domain-specific compiler that generates them on demand. In
	this paper, we describe a novel algorithm for compiling linear
	algebra kernels and searching for the best combination of
	optimization choices. We also present a new hybrid
	analytic/empirical method for quickly evaluating the
	profitability of each optimization. We report experimental
	results showing speedups of up to 130% relative to the
	GotoBLAS on an AMD Opteron and up to 137% relative to MKL on
	an Intel Core 2.</p>
